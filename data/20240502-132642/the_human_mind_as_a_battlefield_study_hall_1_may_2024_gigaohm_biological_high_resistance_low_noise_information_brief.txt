[no audio]Test one, two.[no audio]Sorry, I'm late, ladies and gentlemen. We're getting right started.I'm going to do just a very brief introduction.And then we're going to go.[no audio][no audio]Yes, Mark is putting out some absolutely fantastic content lately.It's just reading.It's just research really actually anyone, you know, could have done if they just maybe paid a subscription to newspapers.com and did the right searches.But Mark is in the batting cage.Yeah, taking the covers off. That's all I got to say. Mark is in the batting cage.Yeah, I don't know what to say. If Mark, if Doc Malick is booting you off his sub-stack, it's exactly where you want to be, I think.There's not much else to say there. I'm not going to do any of that bull in a china shop stuff anymore.I'm going to let the biology speak for itself. I think we are really, if this is Udo, we're doing very, very well.We're about to drop some people on their faces. And so it's not a question of if it's just a question of when.And so I think if we just move cautiously and keep our feet firmly underneath us, don't get off balance in any way.I think everything is going to be just fine in the next couple months. We're going to make some serious, serious progress.Don't forget, I'm on the website of the Red Pill Expo at this stage, listed on the same list of speakers as Mickey Willis and Andrew Kaufman.Think about the extreme irony of that. The extreme, I don't know, craziness that in four years plus of trying to push this stuff out,that, yeah, that's where we are.Anyway, 28 people watching. Thank you very much for being here. Let's get started.[Music][Music][Music]I think that's a really excellent idea, Jeff. We've been, I have been trying to come up with something that fits that for a while.And I've got a couple of things in the works. As far as a PDF goes, lots of people have taken a crack at that.But the PDF from Gigo & Biological and the past couple weeks, three weeks, four weeks of work that Mark and I have been doing.And I don't mean it in any other way than to saying that I'm just really happy to be in this fight together with Mark and with Jessica and with Nick Hudson and with Jonathan Engler and Wolfgang Wodach and Mike Yedden.The list of people that we consider part of our little team has now really, it's a very, very solid list of people who understand the argument we're making.We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society. We want everybody to feel good. That's not the way life is.But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.And I have lied, I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie, you know, I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar.I think it's like really important not to be a liar.[Music]I hope you mean you have to mute that part with Tucker, because I love that Dune one. That thing really rings well with me.I think it's just brilliant.It's Tucker's admission. It's not his whining. It's his admission. There's no clearer way to say that you're a liar by saying that you're a liar.I mean, how much more succinctly could one say it than five times repeating that I'm a liar? I don't want to be, but I am. It's perfect. It's absolutely perfect.Hey, I got to push this button over here in order for this to work.Okay, so we are going to try and truncate this a little bit because the idea, again, is to, well, dispel this enchantment.And so I think repetitive, repeating messages are actually very important for the people who come for the first time.I know it's kind of annoying if I show up late and then I also have to run 45 slides or whatever this is, but these messages are important because we've been consistently putting these messages out with these people's faces underlying them for almost four and a half, four years now.And to think that in all that time, a message so succinct and so clear, a message so patriotic and focused on the truth could have been lost in the noise that they created.Mike Bantenberg, next date.So, we've been lost in the noise that these people created. And the noise is of course all to disguise this plan that's been in the works for a very long time to invert our sovereignty into experimental animal status so that they can feed our biological data into the as yet non existing AI that will, that will solve all of humanity's problems.And so the show on social media featuring AI's latest greatest achievements in art and in in language and and cliff notes is part of this illusion.And as hard as it is for a lot of people to accept it is 100% an illusion.And the illusion goes back a few decades because this illusion of understanding of high fidelity understanding of the biology that underlies health and disease.This mythology has been building for decades. And unfortunately, our parents were completely under its spell.And more importantly, they were under its spell because it wasn't, it wasn't used against them in the same way that it has been used against us in the overt malevolent way that it's been used against us in our lifetime in the form of the childhood vaccine schedule, and in our lifetimes in the form of pandemics.But once we gave power to these charlatans, it's very difficult to get it back, especially if we inherited it this way and we did we have to admit I'm 52 years old.We inherited the world where these charlatans and their mythology was the prevailing narrative.And there are people who have tried to fight against it. There are people who have have touched part of this elephant and paid the highest price.And then there are people who claim to be patriots and who actually are part of the controlled demolition of America.And I don't think that's a message that you can repeat too often because, you know, it's going to take my kids, being aware of it, it's going to take more college kids that are aware of it right now in order to turn this cruise ship around.We're going to need some adults to be able to play the role of teacher and mentor and and and keep people away from social media keep people away from the nightly news keep people away from the PBS news history of America and point people back in the way of the truth.What American history really is what the American economy really is what what fractional reserve banking really is as far as as a possible weaponized source of control.And why Jeffrey Epstein and stories of Jeffrey Epstein's Island might be used to obscure the power of weaponized piles of money.And the Vatican, for example, one of the oldest and probably largest weaponized piles of money.Let's stay focused on the biology for now, though.And let's not take their bait on social media that includes crazy sub stacks.And let's love our neighbors.Let's share this stream if you don't mind. And if you've got the means and you're sitting at home with more money than you know what to do with, feel free.You know, if you've already subscribed to Twitter, if you've already are paying for people's sub stack with him by all means, please go to go and biological and see if you can also support this work.I think it's one of the few places where you can get an objective look at the fifth generation warfare that's being waged upon us and our children.One place where people are going to call it like it is fifth generation warfare is the coordinated lying to the populace.I would say that again, the fifth generation warfare that you need to be afraid of is coordinated lying.And that's what we have here. We have people that have coordinated lied to you and even faked rivalries between one another.And the reason why is because, you know, this picture would be better.This picture would actually be better testing one to this picture would actually be better if we did this.This is really what we're dealing with right now.And if we don't do this, we're never going to break free.That's what I know for sure.While you can see that I did not wash my face this morning with a cold rag of water.I look a little shiny. Sorry about that. This is 10 o'clock show.10 o'clock show is going to take a little adjustment.I'm going to keep doing it though because it's really invigorating to have the whole afternoon to prepare for the next day to look into things to follow up.And I think this work that we've been doing with regard to the, with regard to preons and virology and the Baltimore class of education scheme and the infectious cycle is really paying off.I'm so excited. I'm just so excited.[music]Now it might go to the wrong slide because I didn't change that I bet because I wasn't going to planning to do that whole beginning.Oh no, we're good.Ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga on biological high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by biologists.It is the first of May, 2024.In May of 2020, I was already suggesting that a background signal might be misconstrued as spread and that previous immunity to previous RNA viruses was likely sufficient and that we shouldn't listen to these people.And it's now 21, 22, 23, 24.It's technically four years later.And although the sophisticated biological understanding of the most parsimonious explanation for what has happened over the last five years almost is in front of us now.It's five years.Five years of coordinated lying has brought us to where we are today.And I think it is still relevant to always start the show with intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and thousands of biological faculty members in the United States and around the world should have done known better, should have spoken up, should have waved their arms.Unfortunately, there were only a few of us who did and RNA cannot pandemic is something that anyone with a PhD in biology should be able to rub their little beard for a little while and think, wow, that's a pretty clever way of challenging my notions of what I understand.And then maybe they should use PubMed and start looking into it and pull their head out.It's 2024.Stop hiding within your own little field in your own little question, your own little subunit.And start asking big questions about biology because we are being enslaved by this mythology, and we need your help.The hypothesis that we have if you're still with us is that the who declared a pandemic of a dangerous novel virus but there was none. In fact, it was a hot background.In fact, it was non specific PCR tests. In fact, it was probably non specific lateral flow tests. It was probably non specific PCR primers that were were hand waved into a signal that was already there.But it's a crime. We've called the police. We don't have to explain the motives of the criminal. We don't have to explain the plan. And unfortunately, that's what we've been tricked into doing for the last four years and responding to these so called dissidents.What's exactly happened then, Mr. Cooey. Well, you know, I don't know these people are lying about it and I think you might be coordinated ly lying with them.That's where we are to think that governments and non governmental organizations like the who are interested in taking over the world.And yet somehow or another, they wouldn't have people on both sides playing for them.Like they wouldn't have enough money to plant a few people inside of, I don't know, some organization here or an organization there.Maybe actually inspire a few dissident movements or support a few substacks in order to make sure that their control over where this narrative went was pretty dominant.You don't think that in addition to censoring a few people on Twitter and Facebook that they would have actually not propped up a few people right away from the beginning to make sure that they had people on their team in both places or all places.Can we really still be that naive at this point to believe that it's just governments and it's just Fauci versus Rand Paul, it's just Hekel health alliance and USA ID versus the people who want to tell the truth really do you really believe it's just corporations trying to take advantage of a money hose.It has nothing to do with the weaponized piles of money that have existed for four or 500 years on earth.Come on, ladies and gentlemen, can we wake up and apologize to our children for being so naive.I don't know, I think I think this is probably going to be the wrong slide so I'm just going to escape out of here right now, assuming that it is.And we're just going to start this thing above that I've got planned.I found another video of James Giordano.And I had put it in my list of possible study halls a long time ago I don't know when because I edit the same document all the time as this list.And what's interesting is is that since I had put it in the list and it has to be since I put it in the list.It has become unlisted, which is interesting so I don't know how long we've been hammering home the idea that James Giordano is an interesting figure because he's a forward facing public outspoken person on the internet about these mythologies and these worst case scenarios right.Coffee's almost gone and it's actually still warm so hold on one second.Anything that can ruin the hour that follows it it's cold cup of coffee.So what I find interesting about it is again was that this this si PR I video has been made unlisted since I found it which is kind of interesting.And of course James Giordano is the guy that you know he says you just see the few cases here and there with something that makes people complain.And then the rest of it you just use the internet and let all the wild speculation about what's going on and let non specific tests do the rest of the work.Let a symptomatic transmission and the rumor of it do the rest of the work that's basically the story that he told in 2017 and that everybody really wants to ignore the only people that are not really ignoring it are trying to twist it around and say see James Giordano admits it it's the do d that did it.One of the problems and I'll just say it very quickly one of the problems with saying the do d did it is that the do d doesn't do things they're not told to do.The chain of command doesn't end at the do d and no matter what anybody wants to tell you the chain of command goes farther the buck doesn't stop there so to speak.And so don't be drawn in to think that the do d solves the question or you pulled the mask off now when Dittra is still there when the State Department is still there when the entire Department of Health and Human Services is there to declare the emergency in the first place in the entire administrative body of the president and everybody below including the director of national intelligence is all there.Why in the world would you stop at see it's the do d.I see that's what I had going over there.That's why that was down. Sorry about that.So we're going to watch this video because I think we're probably going to find some interesting things in it and more importantly, because I think it's a nice break from the studying that we've been doing and I've been doing in the background I've actually accomplished a lot more than what we've shown in the past few days or weeks with regard to pre on and protein folding amyloidosis and pre on a genesis.I've been working.And so, if there's anybody out there who's waiting for me to drop the ball on these subjects, or to make a mistake that you think that you're going to be able to distort into CJ's gone full.Full crazy town. You're going to be sorely disappointed by the end of the month of May the, the illusion and the mysteries and the sort of edge of our understanding with regard to pre on and protein folding and and by Rology and RNA fidelity and all of this stuff.I think we're going to be very close to having a pretty succinct answer to these questions in the context of what we know and don't know what people have said and not said, and what is plausible in the context of other biology because that's the main issue here is that people.I don't know, it is one of these rants where it just comes out of nowhere but a lot of these people have convinced you are convinced us to focus on other things other than the details of this biology and I'm afraid that we are right, and we have been right all along when we say that the way out is biology.All we have to do is just do the work that's necessary to really find out what are these people know and what don't they know.We can look at their papers, we can look at what they've published, we can look at what they've said, we can make little cartoons that correspond to what they've said and what they found.And if those cartoons don't tell a story that ends with you only need one pre on.If those stories that they tell don't end in see us, you can design a protein to be an amyloid, a genetic protein.If that's not true, then you will have to come to the conclusion that the people that have been pushing these stories for years in the context of COVID and decades before that are meddlers.They are people who are involved in something else other than America and peaceful existence.Because that's what all of us are involved in. I'm just a very normal guy who if possible would love to have a kind of normal job with colleagues that I wanted to high five every day.And I would love to have work that I was proud of and be able to coach basketball and watch a show or go to a basketball game or go to my daughter's piano recital.Not concerned about people dying on other planets on other continents, not concerned about stealing of thousands of or hundreds of billions of dollars, not worried about whether a war was real or not.Not worried about whether immigration was going to destroy the future, you know.That's me and yet somehow or another we are here now, where all of us are asking these crazy questions and thinking about these crazy ideas, instead of worrying about basketball practice and piano recitals and the local school board meeting.And that's by design. And the human mind as a battlefield is a wonderful title that accentuates what's really happening here.And all we have to do is pull back and realize that this we put our heads inside of a box that's filled with this cacophony, this cacophony about Ukraine and Israel and and and COVID and mandates and and free speech and censorship and transhumanism and and transgender rights and all you got to do is pull your head out of that box and it'll all stop.None of those are questions that you need answers to you already have the answers.Those aren't the most important questions for our day.The most important questions for our day is how do we, if not make the lives of the people around us better.How do we understand how to pull other people's heads out of that box and I think the way to pull other people's heads out of that box is to show them that this box has been in construction for a very, very long time.And remember what we did yesterday I'm glad this flowed into my head this way. Remember what we did yesterday do not forget that the title is a little deceptive when it says ransom yellow and virology.It was also the spars document.And the spars document is that as I characterized it yesterday, this public facing brochure of a program that has a classified part that has a closed doors part that has a lanyards only part.And that part includes the population control part the reduced birth rate part the increased collection of data part the screening of babies part all of that shit.And the need for maximum compliance, the need for uniformed messaging the need to lie to the public in order to assure that we get to these endpoints.And as the spars document lays out. It's not a plan that was a couple months where, oh my gosh there's a novel virus we've got to back the truck up.And a few months later the alarm goes off and somebody declares all clear like Brett Weinstein zero COVID has been reached and shoots a flare.The spars document outlined a decade long story.And if you think of the spars document as a public facing brochure of an actual secret plan, then that secret plan would also be a decade long plan.And you can think of James Giordano as a public facing salesperson for what surely has also a secret component a lanyard only component a for your eyes only component.Otherwise how in the hell could it be that this guy is all over the internet and it's no problem for them.The same reason why the spars document has been around for a few years and it's no problem for them because it's a public facing brochure for a secret plan a back room plan.Just like you know at every corporation there are discussions in the boardroom that are pretty brutal.And that don't take into account the well being of every worker or every contractor or whatever because it's all about profit. You know dang well that we are governed in that way you know dang well that banks think that way you know dang well that private equity funds think that way.They all think of us as consumers. The word consumers means sheep.Let's listen to this and see if we can cheer ourselves up with it because I do think that James Giordano is a wonderful speaker he's super energetic and he gets me really excited about the level of malevolent bamboozlement that has been that has been unleashed upon us over these many many years.And I still don't know why I left and I still don't have my damn water bottle.I'm going to have to send out a smoke signal for that. I'm going to just going to hit play and I might speed it up. It's an hour long and it's 11 and fearless not doing a class today so technically we can just watch it.It's going to be a long one.Here we go.I see this thing in the chat. I just wanted to comment on it. M. Tam Fisher says universities now are private trust funds not education centers. I want you to think about that. How did those trust funds come to exist.They want you to believe it's just because they've got a lot of really rich people that graduated from there and then decided to donate some of their money to the university.Of course all of these weaponized piles of money that you are correct that these universities are were created because the US government subsidize them with Pell grants subsidize them with student loans.A lot of these people like my dumb self went to a private university and got half of the tuition paid by a Pell grant. And so it seemed like wow that's interesting it's basically the same amount of money as the University of Wisconsin Madison.I might as well go there.And now we're supposed to blame all of those kids, which I admit I'm dumb. I went there and signed a piece of paper, but I also had another kid on the other side of the table that was only 24 years old that was a financial aid advisor that was telling me to sign that piece of paper because everybody's doing it and every person that signed that piece of paper was another person that was bringing in about $45,000 in that time to that university in the form of grants and loans.And now we're all subsidized by the US government.And now we're supposed to blame those kids for wanting a college education that they were brainwashed into believing was their only way to climb the ladder, since they were a child, because their parents were brainwashed into giving them that information.And now that system wants you to blame those kids for their student loans, even though they were told that was the only way to go forward.And there were all these programs, government programs to make it really easy for kids that didn't have a plan to go to that college anyway, where they're paying their deans hundreds of thousands of dollars a year where they're paying their football coaches millions of dollars a year their basketball coaches millions of dollars a year.But oh, these giant piles of weaponized money, they're all good. They're great. They're just from big donors.This is the illusion that they've got us in the limited spectrum of debate. Oh, you can bitch about student loans and whether they're fair or not, or whether it's fair to pay them off for people or not.And just forget about the fact that what they really did, what those really represent is a giant subsidy over the past 25 or 30 years for the universities.Because the result wasn't a bunch of rich middle class Americans, right? The investment in the universities resulted in powerful universities that are now on board with this shit.So please see that student loan debate for what it is.It's just a limited spectrum of debate that's like a shouting match between two things that don't matter.And what we should have been saying is that, wow, we let our parents let the government and universities sucker us into this thing and sign on the dotted line when in reality it was just a race to see how many kids can we get to sign this because the government's going to give them money and we are going to get it all.So how many people can we get to sign these papers? I don't know. Let's see. We've got 25 years to see how many people we can get to sign that.And it's not very much different here with the biosecurity state. How many years have been they working to get people to sign on to this? How many people, how many years have been they working to get people on board that they knew weren't going to rock the boat that accepted everything about this that were all about it as a way of governing people as a system of being a part of it.And now you see why the university system doesn't like a guy like me threw me out never gave me tenure I never stood a chance.It's a great point. Thank you for bringing it up. Sorry I went nuts.Guaranteed funding means schools can cost as much as they want. Absolutely. How else do you think Columbia gets away with charging $62,000 a year?Absolutely. That's the way and I got sucked into it too. I'm not happy about it. I'm not complaining about it. I'm just saying I know from firsthand experience how easy it is to go into a financial aid office at 18 years old in a city that's five hours away from where you grew up and sign a piece of paper that says yeah, I'll pay back that in four years.It's extremely easy because they were they were doing it. That was their business model. The more the better. That's why they could send these representatives to your high school with a fancy slide show.They only had to get one or two students at every school they went to in order for that to be worth it. It's an entire four years of tuition. Don't you see it?Imagine if you had a product that the government was willing to fund people loans and grants in order to in order to buy it and all you got to do is sell it. Imagine that.Imagine that kids have been told this is going to be the greatest four years of your life where you get to cheer for football teams and drink beer for four years. Imagine that combination of things and then and then blaming the kids for it.That's how messed up they have us in our heads and now imagine how easy it would be to get us to believe that there was a virus when there probably was already just a background that they're lying about.It's just incredible. I mean if they lie together if they work together, they could convince us of almost anything. That's where we really need to understand. We start that's the baseline here.If your parents work together to lie to you as a kid, you're done that you're going to believe that.If your teachers work together to lie to you whatever they lie to you about at school, it's going to be tough to break.And if the people on TV and social media coordinated the lie to you because of a national security priority that everyone except the fact that a pandemic occurred a global national security priority that everyone except that a pandemic occurred and that it was okay.Not only that but it was a plan to lie to you about it in a very coordinated fashion with a limited spectrum of debate with bad guys and good guys, both working for the state.Now you're starting to get an idea of what fifth generation warfare really is and why they tell you that you can never figure it out.Well I'm telling you you can figure it out.I'm telling you you can figure it out by understanding that it is simply coordinated lying and people pretending to oppose one another pretending to have an argument pretending to take a stand pretending to be a whistleblower.And it's a combination of all these pretenders that has brought us where we are to where we, the vast majority of the population think that they solve the mystery along with everybody else that it looks like the US actually funded the research that led to the eventualthe seeding of the pandemic.All right, sorry.It's just the way it is.I'm going to go here andgo to the technology day of the Stockholm security conference and the session on the human mind as a battle field.I'm to be the bow the director of studies for our moment and disarmament here at SIPRI the Stockholm International Research Institute.And for those of you who are joining for the first time we have four automatic days of this Stockholm security conference. Yesterday we focused on international law.Tomorrow it will be strategies and doctrines and on Thursday we will focus on the protection of civilians.And we will be concluding the conference with a peace price ceremony in Epa, Belgium, which will connect the battle fields of the past with the battle fields of the future.And today we have one more session which will be on current trends in missile technology and missile proliferation will be which will be just after this one, but now on to the human mind.And just like the quantum technology sessions earlier today, we will now zoom in on one technology area and explore implications for current warfare and for future warfare.And as a quantum, it's a very complex, it's a very fast moving area with many interconnections to different technologies. And many of us in the arms control community have come across terms like brain hacking, neuro link humaninterfaces for soldiers brain computer interfaces. Some of it we've seen science fiction movies, some of it we've heard about in the real world and we're all trying to make sense of it, and trying to figure out what's high, what are we missing, and what of the applications that we thinkare actually real and where is it the other way around. So, we're very lucky to have with us today, one of the world's leading experts on this issue.And I should also say that unfortunately, Professor Noel had to cancel his participation this morning due to unforeseen and unforeseeable circumstances.And we have with us Professor Giordano who could actually fill all day and actually all week I believe on this topic. So there'll be plenty to explore in the next hour or so.I'll just say a few words about his background. So he is Professor of neurology, biochemistry and ethics at Georgetown University, and also a bioethicist of the Defense Medical Ethics Center.He is a fellow both at the US Naval Academy of the Naval War College and science advisory fellow of the joint staff at the Pentagon and director of the Institute for Bi defense research and has written many books and articles on this subject.I'm sure you'll agree with me that we are very lucky to have him with us at this session. So, Dr. Professor Giordano will first give an introductory presentation about the state of play current potential future military applications.And then there will be a chance for you to ask questions. I would ask you for that to use the Q&A function and not to use it for statements please only put in questions. And I will then draw on that pool of questions and put them to Jim ball, the Q&A section.But with that now over to you, Jim.Thank you very much Miss power and so again thank you to each and all of you for having me here it's a privilege and an honor to present at this forum. And I think the title of the forum is very important, not just the brain or the mind as the 21st centurylandscape, but also the implications of what current science and technology can do the way it may be used the way it most likely will be used and what that infers for stances of preparedness readiness, and the sustainability for peace, particularly given the very influentialthat the brain mind will play in a variety of subtle influences in the way we think, feel and act. And perhaps a larger question is what needs to be done in terms of multinational engagement guidance and oversight so as to maintain an ethical course forward, while being very realistic and appreciating the multinational nature of the enterprise.We consider neuroscience and technology to be ever more unified entity. I mean doesn't he just kind of say it already right there isn't he just saying that it's an international enterprise.So it's a global effort. And the human mind is the battlefield. It's a global effort to convince us of something.And remember this is the public facing brochure of something that actually has a very large classified component I'm sure of it obviously I mean, how could you argue that it doesn't.And this guy's job is to provide the public facing component and probably also the part of the, the, the closed session component as well. At least he's probably more aware of it than we are.But to the extent to which what behind the scenes is super technology and scary nanobots and advanced AI versus a bunch of people who are coordinated ly lying about those things is really up for grabs and I would argue that we should always err on the side of exaggeration and lies because as Peter teal so eloquently said,the specialization and a lot of these fields has made it very easy for people to lie and exaggerate and so that's where he starts with regard to thinking about these things from quantum physics all the way up to what I would call by Rology is also right in there.And see how exciting this is now because we're able to really work through this in a way that that keeps people objective and keeps people able to keep their eye on the ball which is reminding people over and over again remember coordinated like not just one liar,but a liar, who is telling a lie, which harmonizes with other lies.It's a very, very magic spell that's why I call it an enchantment lies that harmonize with other lies are very convincing especially if mixed in there are a couple chords of truth.This guy is one of the masters.I refer to this as neuro S&T. And the reason for that is quite simple in that there is a relative inseparability between the science, that is to say, the understanding and insights that we gain to the mechanisms of the nervous system in the brain and what that infers for the functions of brain,most broadly construed to be mind, but perhaps more metaphysically, if not practically construed to be identity, self decisions, feelings, and the expression of same in a variety of our interactions from the personal to the political.But over in a but I would argue that that because we are a pattern integrity the sacred biology dictates that these things are not separable.So it's interesting, for example, that around the world you can find lots of institutes that are called the so and so brain mind Institute.As if brain and mind is something that we can talk about as separate entities that one doesn't come from the other or isn't part of the other or isn't the same thing or whatever it is.And this is part of that magic spell which is designed to take a little peg away or drop the level of reverence that you have for what you are as a sacred be.And that brain mind idea has been going around for a very long time and for a very long time I was under its spell. And so that's why I feel very important need to pause it there because brain mind.Anytime you hear someone say that is already a duopoly, which suggests a kind of lack of sophistication that you can pull the brain away and study it like a clock without really having to address the question of mind or experience or consciousness or soul or spirituality.And that is that that in and of itself is an enchantment so be very aware of that.Above that is that this science has given the ability to assess the brain, access the brain and defect the brain and the science those last two are completely wrong we can measure things, but we can't read it, and we can't program it so that's that'simpressive has been capable by a tool set.He said capable by an increasing tool set a toolkit set of technologies.Those technologies have allowed us to advance certain theoretical constructs about the brain, but have also taken us to the limit of our capabilities to assess and defect the brain and therefore have prompted the development of new tools.So what that affords us is the actual capability to harness and engage neuroscience and its technologies in what is increasingly become known as integrative scientific convergence relative desiloing of the physical natural life.I have heard a lot of people talking about bio convergence and sending me things that you got to talk about bio convergence.The very short thing would be for me that bio convergence is another one of these enchantments that if you think about it and try to understand it.You are, you are accepting its relevance and what's what's bio convergence mean unless you really allow them to put shit in your head or implant stuff under your skin what is it that otherwise bio convergence is not carrying around a cell phone even though they would like you to believe thatthat's that's part of bio convergence this thing still remains a tool.It's a very, very small laptop that if you put the right apps on it can also be kind of annoying.But if you just think about what this is it's just a connected little iPad that you can put annoying things on or mentally disabling things on.This is not bio convergence yet.Even if you put earphones in your head it's not really bio convergence yet.What they want you to think is that that's a that's a normal a continuous let's say a continuous progression.They want you to believe that you're already on the progression so you might as well accept the future stages of that progression.And that's the illusion the enchantment and the lie.Bio convergence doesn't happen unless we allow it to happen.Bio convergence isn't an inevitability by all that convergence hasn't already happened because people took vaccines.And bio convergence isn't happening because we have cell phones bio convergence is in a concept that's supposed to give you the idea that you're already on some slippery slope so you might as well just lay back and slide.Be careful.And social sciences in those ways that provide a more three dimensional understanding of what the brain and its functions are and how the brain and its functions can be assessed, accessed and affected.And the nature of those smart.Smart suppositories you know the thing is they could get people to use those now.I think that would be the old maybe we should get the, what is it the Babylon B should do a story about a an AI that you can put up instead of a pin.I think most probably is aimed at what I would consider to be the low hanging fruit. In other words, much of the driver of contemporary neuroscience and technology is aimed at biomedical purposes, if you will, relatively benevolent ends wanting to do good to improve the human condition to reduce the humanpredicament of disease injury and perhaps even the frailties that are a consequence of our finitude and aging.But please understand to paraphrase the works of philosopher Alistair McIntyre, we have to ask what good.Which rationale.Who's justice. What we may see whoever the proverbial we are as being a viable good can also be seen in certain ways as providing inequities, inequalities or in some cases, frank engagements, harms and burdens to others.I have a nice way of summarizing this a while ago I used to say that there are two types of people in the limited spectrum of debate. There are either these stupid complicated people.And I think one example might be Judy Mikovits another example might be James Giordano otherwise it's the dumb simple people like Paul Offit or, or, or Angie Rasmussen or who are other dumb simple people.You know, it's just a very simple solution. And then the other people have like all these big words and all this stuff to say I still don't know if he said anything real other than trying to justify himself as an ethicist and the fact that he can, he can dissect the ethical questions down tosub questions and sub questions of sub questions. It's pretty impressive. But over and above that understand if we can use the Jordan Peterson of Georgetown that's a great one.And then there's only a case of how we define good. And then whether or not that science and technology can be used in a way that is withheld from others to prevent them from accessing those goods and enjoying those goods, or can be inverted as a consequence be used to incur burdens risks and harmsOkay, we got to see is that by understanding the brain and pretty brutal, it gives us the capability of affecting human activities on individual group and perhaps even population levels.And these effects can influence a variety of postures including postures towards peace postures of vulnerability and volatility postures of violence and bellicose.And of course I think it becomes critical to understand that like any science and technology throughout human history, the capability potential and the allure of using cutting edge science and technology in ways that could be leveraged a variety of competitive engagements from the economic, all the way to the bellicose isSo if we consider those ways that these realities are enacted, we must understand the existing domains in which neuroscience and technologies are employed in what was formally referred to as NSID applications, National Security Intelligence and Defense Operations, National SecurityWell there's a bit of a misnomer with that because in some ways, what are these things? Well there's a bit of a misnomer, National Security Intelligence and Defense Operations, National Security Intelligence and Defense Operations.All these acronyms. When do you think this talk is from? It's from 2021.This is during the pandemic he's talking like this as if the pandemic isn't going on as if we didn't. This is the Stockholm Security Conference in 2021.This was uploaded December 15, 2021, almost 2022.Coordinated lying across the entire spectrum of the limited spectrum of debate. Coordinated lying. Even these lies are coordinated with some of the lies about the vaccine schedule that are being told.These lies are coordinated with the opposition to the vaccine schedule. It seems to always fight for free speech rather than just say the vaccine schedule is criminal.Many times if you heard somebody say I just want randomized controlled trials for vaccines, I just want vaccines tested.I only woke up two years ago ladies and gentlemen I'm still pulling my head out but I'm telling you a lot of these people who claim that they are the dissident that they are the resistance that they have risked life and limb.They have put everything on the line because this is for all the marbles. They're liars and they are part of this coordinated, harmonized set of lies.Remember it's many weaponized piles of money. They're not dumb. They don't just control a few news broadcasts. They haven't just started doing this since they were, you know, since they declared it or since they got lucky.Nothing happened in 2020 that wasn't planned. Nothing happened in 2020 wasn't already on a list of acts.It's a theater show. And the fact that this guy can give this talk at the end of 2021 at the beginning of 2022 and have not mentioned anything to do with the pandemic yet at all is almost a direct admission to me that the pandemic is in and of itself exactly what he is going to explain right here.It is a war on the human mind. It is a national security intelligence and defense operation designed to convince the global population that something happened that did not happen so that they can be governed by that misunderstanding that mythology forever.Well, there's a bit of a misnomer with that because in some ways it white washes the scenario. Perhaps more appropriate is to understand how neuroscience is in their technologies can be employed in warfare intelligence and what various collectives view to be agendas and initiatives of national security whatever nations they may be.Here, I allude to some of the wonderful work I had the privilege and honor of undertaking with my colleagues at the European Union human brain projects, focal group, the European Union human brain project so he's really not just an American.He's connected to other global interests other weaponized piles of money other other political interests.Georgetown.And I think that's a good point on dual use brain science and not that was my best be this and but I'm a colleague professor Dr. Kattinka ever's of Uppsala in Sweden as well as any of my colleagues that were participatory in that working group.And what is important to understand as a consequence of some of the results of our working deep dive is that the ability to surveil overseas guide and perhaps govern the brain sciences is highly contingent upon the understanding that these brain sciences are multinational in their enterprise and in their effect.And so the discourse must widen and in many cases is dialectic.At this point in time there are a number of neuroscientific tools and technologies that are viable, if not already uptaken into warfare intelligence and national security operations and agendas.Nothing I'm about to tell you science fictional. It is all science fact in terms of what is currently available or is what at high technological readiness level.So it's to be made available for the next two to five years.Wow. All right.How can we hear these techniques and technology.Let's hear it.Again, any aspect of medicine.And in this case, we need to consider military medicine.I feel like he's about to show me all kinds of different time shares that I can choose from.But when we're considering military medicine, it's not just a question of what we can do to treat those members of the military, when in fact they are injured or or ill.But what can we do preventatively.Here we see a gray zone arising working, if you will, left of bang, where bang is some event that induces trauma, insult, injury or change.Can we work to the left of that?Can we, for example, employ the neurosciences and technologies and areas of preventative military occupational medicine to restore what we may consider to be hope and acronym for maintaining health, instilling operational and occupational protection and enabling these personnel to do their job effect those missions moreCapably and effectively.Did you hear that?Did you hear that?Isn't that funny military occupational medicine is just the enchantment that this guy can cast is.Sorry, his spectacular military occupational medicine is what he means by that is augmenting soldiers, maybe make it so that they can't feel emotion for a few weeks, maybe so that they don't feel any remorse for a few weeks.These are the kinds of things that he's imagining. It's pretty impressive.Those ways that will enhance their survivability, keep them protected, and ultimately may also affect the way they interact with competitors or adversaries hope.What are we hoping to do when we consider operational and occupational protection and enabling the combat warfighter, the intelligence operator, military personnel of all types to do their jobs better.Well, this then gives rise to the idea of what constitutes optimization.What constitutes enhancement.If in fact optimization and enhancement differs from some form of treatment, particularly when healthy individuals are involved and what are the implications for taking individuals beyond some stated norm.And is that not on one level or another.The implicit if not explicit goal of almost any professions training and certainly military intelligence training to be the best of the best to do those jobs well and to do them in a way that provides some advantage to one's own forces against other forces, whoever they may be.Which gets us back to the idea of what is good.If a military, what is any more some operational national security institution or organization reports to be able to protect the ideology ideals ways of life things that are held viable can kick the polis or some political agency or organization.Then that's held as a viable good and can be used to justify the applications of these types of techniques and technologies.Perhaps in some of more gray zone operations and neurosciences can also be paired to intelligence operations to afford increased cognitive capability for intelligence operators and systems to be linked to computational systems.So as to be able to discern more accurately what may be an intelligence viable signal from what may be noise, whether that's a human intelligence signal intelligence, communication intelligence.And of course the issue there becomes, what are we actually doing can we also not only affect the way we perceive and gain intelligence, but can we use this in a proactive way.In other words for psychological or what's now referred to as neurocognitive operations NCOs to create more viable narratives propaganda if you images to therefore create impressions experiences in others that affect them in certain ways that we now have a deeper understanding.Maybe we could stage an event in New York City hospitals where we made it seem like through a combination of fraud and and getting rid of a lot of people that were already sick.We could create the illusion of a pandemic and then say that it was the start of something very deadly and get everybody to lock down.And then we could show him some images from around the world of people passing out and give them the experience.Holy shit, did you hear what he just said. I'm going to go back and play it again it was so good.That's incredible.Raiders and systems to be linked to computational systems.So as to be able to discern more accurately what may be an intelligence viable signal from what may be noise, whether that's a human intelligence signal intelligent.You mean like a podcast with real reach that you might need to, you know, co-op maybe a message or or or a person that you need to co-op.You could use an algorithm to find that you could use programming and social media to make sure that those people had reach only where you wanted to have it, or you could make sure that you got somebody in front of them that could step in front of them and claim to be an expert doing a bunch of analysis.For example, like have Sasha Latapova step in front of somebody like Catherine Watt and pretend that she did all the research and never mentioned Catherine Watt again.Take over the narrative of it's the DoD.And then we can put her all over the internet and let Catherine Watt sit at home and pretend that and feel comfortable that Sasha's representing me very well.When in reality she's not.When in reality, she's part of this this thing, this show, this theater.Interestingly, this is in Stockholm in 2022.I wonder if we looked up when when Sasha Latapova was on stage with Meryl Nass and Robert Malone when Meryl Nass said something about the statement department and Robert Malone almost visibly.I wonder when that was that might have been in 2022 isn't that weird.It's all one big show ladies and gentlemen.And the show has lots of different acts and different stages.And so if you're in this group of people following this group of people through this part of the bureaucracy, you would have seen this part of the show.If you were in Australia and you were a nurse you would have seen that part of the show.And if you were in Japan and you were a street vendor you would have seen that part of the show.All the show is different but all the show somewhere inside of every one of these shows are the same group of people with the same core message.There was a virus that killed millions of people probably came from a lab.That's why we should control demolish America and turn to a global system because these these countries by themselves they don't work they're just they're just a big problem.And so collectively you have bankers doing it you have you have representatives and senators doing it you have presidential candidates doing it they're all part of it.They're all part of this weaponized piles of money global governance structure and they all want a bigger piece of the pie.They all know that this ship is sinking.And so we've got to come together as the peasants we've got to come together as the people that are renting our house.We've got to come together as the people that only have $534 in their bank account at the start of a month.And of course the issue there becomes what are we actually doing can we also not only affect the way we perceive and gain intelligence, but can we use this in a proactive way.In other words for psychological or what's now referred to as neurocognitive operations NCOs to create more viable narratives propaganda if you will images to therefore create impressions experiences in others that affect them in certain ways that we now have a deeperunderstanding of how we can affect the brain to elicit emotional behavioral and perhaps even community and cultural responses.And what does that mean on one hand it's a funny conversation to have with my chat and I do think that you know James Giordano's messages and going to be that great so we don't have to necessarily always listen to this.I do think that we the people really are only hope and I do think the very idea of money itself may be one of the ultimate weapons I absolutely agree fiat money is an ultimate weapon.And I do think that there's something earlier that I said that is really relevant to this discussion that we are considered consumers.buy stuff and that's our function in American society and capitalist society. I'm not saying capitalismis good or bad or communism is good or bad I'm saying that our culture is not singing and dancingand music and sport and and well-being irrespective of what we might be led to believe it is our cultureis consumerism our culture is materialism our culture is having things that other people can seeand so when we fight for America we want to be very careful about what we're fighting for becauseI'm not fighting for that I'm fighting for sport I'm fighting for dance I'm fighting for jazz musicI'm fighting for live music I'm fighting for chorus and choir concert band and symphoniesI'm fighting for comedy and genuine science that's not paparian falsification of null hypothesesI'm fighting for big ideas and big visions of the future imagining things that aren't and why notand a lot of these people aren't doing that a lot of these people are just telling a storyand no matter where they go and what message they give they're always telling the same storyit's not a message of hope it's a message of giving up on America it's not a message of hope it'sa message of giving up on your neighbor it's not a message of hope it's a message of of doom and gloomand that's not what gigo-ombiological is about that's not the faith that I have that's not thefeeling I have that's not the hope that I have that's not the world that I see when I look into theeyes of my children I see a world of a lot of strife and turmoil a lot of lies and frustration to comebut I also see a lot of light because this stuff doesn't even make any sense anymorethis stuff is just ridiculous nowand and and the beauty is is that there is real biology out there there's real stuff out therethere's a real world out there and we just have to take it back we just have to what did I say inthe beginning you got to pull your head out of that box where all that noise is listen for the birdsagain listen to your kids play the piano again listen to the squeak of the shoes on the basketballfloor again listen to the sound of a shovel in the dirt again listen to the sound of a lawnmoweror your favorite music that's where we're going baby that's where we're going we're going backand we're going forward at the same time we're going left or right or we're going sideways we'regoing not where they want us to go we're going to lead ourselves away from this transhuman nightmarethat they want us to accept as just the inevitable reality slippery slope that we're on that'sridiculous half of this stuff doesn't even exist even though he just insisted that all of it ishis reality right now or in the next five years you mean like kurt weiler kurtzweiler says that in15 years there will be no disease and he can upload his brain into a computer or AIit's just a different time frame a different time scale to try and bully you into acceptingthese concepts let's do it certainly I think that the idea the intent and perhaps the hopeis that by better understanding the way our brains work we'll gain greater insight and appreciationfor those things we have in common be able to bridge our differences and in so doing facilitateimproved communication to avoid the escalation to volatility to reduce that's hilarious oh my goshthat's really funny that's very similar to saying we turned over all our decision making to machineshoping that we would be happier and in reality all we did was turn over our decision making to themen that control the machines that's exactly what he's talking about it's fantastic whose vulnerabilityis therefore to avoid violence hey I love it say it again basketball and the loss of americanfundamentalism this is a basketball is an NBA basketball is a microcosm of that you know thereason why you should never compare Michael Jordan and his colleagues to the basketball players ofnow the main reason because the rules of the game aren't the same anymoreif the rules of the game aren't the same anymore then how can we compare the players of the 80sin the 90s to the players of the 2000s it's just not there anymore because sport isn't what it usedto be anymore because they are undermining our culture they are undermining our identitythey are undermining our sense of right and wrongthat's why the NBA the rules don't get stricter wouldn't you think they would get stricter youknow like when you move the lines back also the lines mean more than they do when you're a kidmaybe you could let kids have an extra half step until they're 12 and then take it away but insteadwe give extra steps to the guys that make millions of dollars a yearyou see the irony of that it's it's the exact same thing that we're doing in every otherfacet of our culture every other facet of our perceived reality is being inverted and underminedin exactly the same way and the challenge is to be able to pull back pull back far enough to seethat it's all the same it's all one giant inversion and that what that's what makes it easy for you tofocus on and get trapped in one of these small little bubbles and think that wow this is themost important thing to fight about right now we better protest about Gazait's an amazing enchantment ladies and gentlemen and this guy is kind of more or less explaining itin really flowery language what they've done to us over the course of the last four years in a globaleffort a national security intelligence and defense operation that was actually a neuropsychologicaloperation and whatever he whatever thing he used for thatwow ladies and gentlemen isn't it fun to be here now where we're a couple dominoes ahead of thestory and as long as we don't get distracted by the shiny objects that are flying aroundthat we can actually keep moving forward and start to morse succinctly every day have something toteach our children have some way of counteracting of opposing this nonsense it's it's really feels goodbe polyanish because the reality is that these tools and techniques offer viable and in some casesestimated valuable capability to be able to assess and modify the thoughts actions and thereforeoverall stature of others the operational definition if you will of a weapon taken fromthe Oxford English dictionary a weapon is simply a means of contending against othersfar more colloquially we see this in bellicose framework in other words it means tohe is the word bellicose twice come on dude a weapon is some means of influence deterrenceand the question then becomes can the brain sciences be weaponized in those ways that may beless lethal or non-lethal yet their influence be overwhelmingly more powerful in that the effectsare getting at the essence of what it means to be a relatively enviable space of the self of identityof mind of being able to assess and perhaps control thoughts emotions and behaviors remotelyand in so doing influence postures of individuals groups collectives and perhaps populate how couldyou control things remotely could you do it with the internet could you do it with coordinated lyingon the internet what about coordinated lying plus um coordinated programming of what people seeonline i wonder if you could control what people think and perceive by doing that it doesn't haveto be nanobots ladies and gentlemen it doesn't have to be nanobots that are sprayed from an airplanecan just be coordinated liars stick into the same story for many many yearsand then when the fire alarm goes off they can say yeah it's what we told youwe are breaking through ladies and gentlemen because we actually hit our face on the brickwall while we were running and then they told us that that's not a brick wall and we didn't believethem and here we are it's fun times ladies and gentlemen fun times thanks for being here with meis there some line that's being crossed there whereby this cognitive liberty is being intrudedupon to paraphrase the words of my colleague mea farahani at the University of Pennsylvaniawell i think if we understand weapon in that context we can then frame the brain sciences intothose domains and those tools if you will that could be weaponized in such ways generally we canparse these into two non-mutually exclusive and interactive domains the assessment neuro technologieswhich include things like various forms of neuro imaging neuro physiological recording neuro genomicsneuro genetics epigenetics and phenotypics neuro proteomics and the use of neuro big data whichwent coupled to decision technologies machine learning and ai creates an omnibus juggernautof capability to not only acquire data and utilize data an omnibus or joggernaut of capability likethe guy like eats a thesaurus for breakfast or something but also to manipulate the data itselfwhereby assessment immediately can turn into effect this then brings us into the realm of theinterventional neuro technologies and perhaps worse and foremost if not easiest is the ability to useextant systems of computational technology and engineering together with decision technologybig data acquisition and use in various forms of soft to hard ai to manipulate the data themselvesand by manipulating the data on large scales it may be possible to literally paint a new realityof what an individual is to implant information in the large scale data banks make individuals appearto have certain neurological or psychiatric conditions to affect their capability to dotheir job by virtue of if you will their profile their data profile by affecting aspects of theirmetadata so that they're regarded and perhaps treated in different ways economically sociallywell terribly politically but wait there's more the more we know the further we can goand one of the existing concerns is that the ubiquity of what's called bio data particularlyneuro bio data creates certain vulnerabilities and target abilities to be able to create precisionpathogens now those pathogens need not be the traditional drugs bugs or toxins they can alsobe certain devices that can be drugs bugs and toxins now he's going to get into his littlegroove again about certain things but um what what I want to say here at novel pharmaceuticalsthat's just spraying stuff or lacing things poisoning people and not a neuro microbiologicalscould be something like a a bacterial infection that also secretes some kind of neurotoxinorganic neurotoxins again are just chemicals um neurotechnologicals is not even a wordbut he would like you to think it is cyber linked neuro cog manipulation right now that's justcell phones and apps and social media um I think he's talking about maybe internet linked typethings it's all again this is bamboozlement this is enchantment I don't like the word bamboozlementas much as I like an enchantment that's what people do when they have the the tongue of a serpentthey're enchanters and some people I'm sure have characterized me as an enchanter because he's sucha slick talker he's you know it's a fake thing but it this is different what you experience hereis someone trying to understand making mistakes as I do it and expressing a love of biologythat has existed in my life my whole life and I don't know what else to do with it soI complain on the internet about the misrepresentation of biology all over the place and I didn'trealize that that was my calling until this stupid pandemic happened and then only then did Iawaken from the slumber that I was in as an academy magicianso I made a lot of mistakes and and shouted about a lot of the wrong things for 2020 and 21but I also said a lot of the right things in that time and was encouraged to say a lot of the wrongthings by some of the people that are still meddling with us today that's why I can't stopI've really seen it from the inside I've talked to these people shake their handstaken selfies with them and had them lie to me or backstab me laterit's kind of personal for me I try to keep it as objective as possible I would really like tointerview this dude someday retuned to individual parameters of anthropometry physiology todifferentially affect individuals in a variety of ways to direct or compromise their capabilitiesI think we're at a low at the moment because we are so dead on balls accurate and actually a coupledominoes ahead of them that's why the the things that are happening right now on substack arehappening right now on substack people keep writing silly substacks without saying the right namesor without without summarizing in an honest way and now they're overextending themselves theylook like fools and so it's all just really a matter of time you just have to keep letting themgo farther and farther over the over the tips of their skis that's that's my that's my plannobody right now has warranted a a stream about any particular person anymore becausethey're making such fools of themselves and the list is very long all of these people seem tosay almost exclusively useless stuff lately and if it's not useless stuff it's the stuff that's onthe slide with the with the um with the dune sound effects novel virus millions dead gainof function yada yada it's incredible and what's fun is to hear it in 2022 this guy gave this talkand anybody that took him seriously obviously took the gain of function lab leak seriouslyobviously they believe that's real this is this is totally a lie that harmonizes very well with thatand of course the story of a gain of function virus that we had to do something aboutand transfection was rushed in process one was different than process two is also a lie thatharmonizes very well i'm sorry but you know sometimes there's nothing else to do but keeprepeating the truth over and over again the truth is is that these people are harmonizing liarsit's like a very macabre barbershop quartetfor thought emotion and action and the tenor is is is francis collins and the baritone isjames giordano and the bass is uh is uh maybe peter hotez i don't know putting all of thesetogether we see a new toolkit that essentially engages not only those domains that have been welladdressed by the current language of the biological toxins weapons conventions chemical weaponsconventions and various declarations of signatory treaties but in some ways sidesteps that as i hopeto show you which may as we've called for together with our international colleagues necessitate arevisiting if not revision of the language scope and tenor of these existing conventions and treesnew drugs for example that are able to penetrate the brain space far more cable at much lower dosesis he for example linking pharmaceuticals no to nano engineered scaffolds micelleschaperones that allow fastal pentagons micelles micelles is a word that i learned from robertmalone actually that's just a big nano particle that's funny prints into the brain space sometimesthrough means that can be rather clandestinal covert inhalation trans germally and doing sowith higher specificity in fact in some cases targeting these inhaling or going through yourskin and you don't even know it that's great pharmaceuticals to be able to work in key individualsand groups of individuals based upon an understanding of their pharmacogenomics and dynamics here toowe see the ability to generate novel microbiological whether that may be bacteria fungi viruses andincreasingly there is worry about the potential weaponization of prions that based upon individualcollective and population information develop yeah weaponizing of prions he'sthat's fantastic oh my gosh that's fantastic holy shit whether that that's amazing fungi virusesand increasingly there is worry about the potential weaponization of prions that based upon individualcollective population information develop so it's a high safety effect in key individualsbecause individual or more global more universal creating if you will bellicose value and affectingrelatively benign general populations a conversation you'll have later in your conferenceas well we can utilize various methods of gene editing and synthetic biology to develop organicneurotoxins that are far more stable less labile more effective and can be used with precisionparticularly if and when delivered through the variety of unmanned vehicles aerial ground orsea based and a variety of technological devices that can be used to augment or change cognitiveoh my gosh that's brilliant it would be so much cheaper to start spraying people with ddt and arsenicagain seriously this is wonderful i can't believe he said it is i could already end the stream rightnow it's like this is it this was the whole reason why this was in my study haul list fori don't know how long it's been there and how long it got things got piled on top of iti have not watched it this is just awesome i don't even know what he's gonna say for the next45 minutes but it can't be better than that things that can be done or dopped for exampletranscranial magnetic and electrical stimulation vagal nerve stimulation and there is a robust moveforward to create implantable devices that are non-invasive or minimally invasive in theirimplantation methods so as to create next generation neuromodulation that allows real-time access toread from the living brain and write into the living brain remotely read and write into the brainis the dumbest lie they can tell i just i am as a neuroscientist it just makes me want to pukebecause that is like that is so many decades away that we shouldn't probably even use the word decadesit is just ridiculous to think read and write into the brain that is the most absurd thingcan you imagine saying listen carefully can you imagine saying that you could drill a holein the side of your your pc and usefully read and write to it do you think there's any way that youcould usefully penetrate your laptop with a series of probes and wires through a hole that you createin order to write and read to that laptop how hard would that be to do knowing that we know allabout the laptop we know all about it we have the schematics it would still be pretty hard to doit would be pretty really hard to do i want you to think about that very freaking carefullyit would be very hard to doand he just said he just said it that we're going to be able to do that with our braincome on such capacity with this ability i think also comesnecessary and authentic anticipation and in some cases anxieties and apprehensionsplease understand please understand that it's very different read and write in the brain is notthe same as implanting something that will get an infection or cause an immune reaction or a strokefive years from now that in the in the short term can be stimulated to get you hungry or can bestimulated to sexually arouse you or can stimulate you to need to act or or uh get angryyes we can rudimentary rudimentarily stimulate parts of the brain to create certain behavioralpatterns or certain impetuses yes we can do that that's not reading and writing from the brainthat's not usefully augmenting intelligence that's not correcting depression that's not any of thethings that are implied in this enchantment and so the reason why if you feel a little negativeenergy here it's because this is where i spent the last 25 years focusing my love of biologyon the question of how does the brain work when i ran into what i consider to be the irreduciblecomplexity of our sacred biology i often met neuroscientists who said no that's easy we canmake a model of it no that's easy we can make a model of itand i have been unable to express the amount of frustration that i've had in in neurobiologythese let these past 15 or 18 years working as an academy magician not being able to express thisappreciation for what we can't know and the irreverence of all these people that keep talkingabout how we're gonna know itso that's why i'm here that's why i'm not giving up on this that's why i feel like i've got to developthis message rather than give up on it because there is a sacred biology to have reverence forthere is a sacred biology that's worth trying to understand as much as we can there is a sacredthere is a sacred biology that if expressed correctly and understood correctly could result in morereverence for who we are and who our grandchildren are and what our well-being should beand that's not this message of course that's not what james giordano's message is but that'salso not what robert malone's message is that's also not what pierre cori messages that's also whatnot tony fouchi's messages or or any of these other people who purport to be on one side orthe other of a limited spectrum of debate about whether or not the spike protein was a priongait of function protein or not we are making huge progress ladies and gentlemen thanks to peoplelike james giordano and also everybody that supports this stream and a lot of you smart asses in thechat i love it that the neurosciences and the development of neuro technology is not theprovance of if you will a given few at present there are multiple large-scale national levelbrain science initiatives that are pouring billions of currency units into projects in thebrain sciences again the most notable direction of these the driver clearly is explicit thosethings that are benevolent wanting to do good reduce the burden of human predicament and diseaseinjury capability but that capability curve exists along a spectrum and here too the ability toutilize the brain sciences to improve our quality of life and or to use the brain sciences inpreventive ways immediately allows us to confront again the idea of occupational preventive militaryintelligence medicine super soldiers proverbial super spooks intelligence operator but recallhere too what is my good may not necessarily be your good what i and my kin and kith hold to bevaluable defensible may not in fact be what yours defines to be so and so the use of advancingtools science and technology inclusive of the brain and cognitive sciences in those initiativesand agendas that can be used in defensive ways or in some cases explicitly offensive ways todecapabilize others to reduce their will their willingness to decapabilize others decapabilizei mean that's a that's a pretty bad word in my mind but that's what they did to us in order toremove our ability to exercise informed consent which includes saying no they decapabilized usthey decapabilized us of exercising informed consent another great james giordano summarystatement they decapabilized us of making informed decisions about transfection informeddecisions about lockdown and their relevance or danger for us they decapabilized us and theydecapabilized us not with neurotoxins or nanobots but with careful coordinated lying perhaps theircognitive and physical capabilities to the advance towards some level of volatility or violenceis very very real but more than that what becomes important to understand is that the underlyingphilosophies ethics anthropologies and therefore limitations and constraints on the brain sciencesin terms of research in their translation into various practices inclusive of those that couldbe used for military medicine and to be used for military warfare intelligence operationsdiffer at he's not mk ultrid he's the guy that records the the the recordings that they playfor people who are being mk ultrid as a consequence of culture you know that large scale initiativesof brain sciences are multinational there's an increasing asian effort to be sure that is explicitthis is advancing developed nations and giving them certain capabilities to leverage the brainsciences in and across fusions of governmental initiatives research initiatives and commercialinitiatives that at very very least could leverage the brain sciences and economic ways to createnew balances of power on medical markets and perhaps even lifestyle if not military marketsas well what we're seeing is a rise in what has been colloquially referred to asneuro hacking i wonder if i played this guy at night in my headphones if i would gain hisis magnificent vocabulary do it yourself community which not is not problematic per sebut is certainly vulnerable to influence and manipulation by state actors and non-state actorsand the development of proxies both state and non-state proxies state and non-state actorsstate and non-state proxies maybe like f l c c c or the american frontline doctors or the wellnesscompany or dare i say i can children's health defense or some of the people in those organizationsdare i say that i think i do dare i say that that some of the political parties in america mightbe part of these state and non-state actors and they might even fund proxies dare i say thatnon-state actors like large weaponized piles of money might fund proxies in order to wrestle poweraway from national governments or state governments or to influence the state or local governments imean interestingly he's saying all of the truth out loud in big enough words so that skilled tvwatchers won't catch it but people on the inside will people that are privy to the the lanyarddiscussions people that are privy to the to the to the classified websites they understand exactlywhat he's saying and what he's not saying which a lot of things that i've learned one of the biggestlessons that i've learned in the pandemic is that everything is at admission and you should think abit like a lawyer in that sense everything is admission and what you don't say or say both ofthem there are admissions and one of the things that i think frustrates a lot of people is whenthey are not thinking clear enough to understand that everything being said is an admissionand if you read people's sub stacks for example with that in mind the insistence uncertainty aboutcertain certain things becomes an admission within the global neuroscience community and doyourself community that can be manipulated in those ways to affect sovereign states through theinfiltration of capabilities within those states jurisdictions difficulty if you will to monitorfor example here in the united states there is a directed program with our federal bureau ofinvestigation to work with the do-it-yourself neuro hacking community in cooperation with interpolso as to maintain the stringency rigor and if you will ethical probity of that community and renderthem somewhat more resistance to infiltration i do think there's a lot to communication that isnon-verbal and i do think that that is very maladaptively i'm gonna try and talk like him fora second maladaptively augmented by social media and our cyber presence in other words you and italking in this way is not as bad as listening to him um because you and i have an ongoingrelationship and you kind of know um you know my mannerisms and my my tendencies and so youyou may feel some connection to knowing when i'm hiding something or knowing when i'm not tellingeverything that i should be or when i'm in a bad mood or this kind of thing and so there's a lot ofnon-verbal communication that's occurring between us because of our real ongoing relationship thatdoesn't occur when you meet somebody for the first time in a zoom meeting and allows and i would goback to the peter teal thing um allows lies and exaggeration to exist in greater quantityand greater proportion because personal contact makes that more difficult i don't think it's 80percent but i do think that that's one of the reasons why i remind you every once in a whilewith a slide with a lot of selfies to remind you that i have met these people in person they'veshaken my hand and that means some of them have lied to me to my face and i would argue that oneof the gifts that you get if you're if your parents are abusive one of the gifts that you get if youhave been don't have the optimal childhood is that you have suspicion of adults and you knowthat adults lie and if you as a child find out that adults lie even the adults that you trustedthe most then you grow up with a very good sense of when people are lying to you you almost havethis gut instinct i sweat different and i get a little feeling at the top of my head when somebody'slying to me it's very strange and some of these people have lied to me and only later did i actuallyfigure it out that wow they really did they freaking look me in the eye they said a bunch ofshit that wasn't true and hope that i would accept it and even better they hope that i would go andshout it from my street and occasionally i have and then realize later that it's a mistake that'sthe kind of experience that i bring to this if you're joining me for the first time and gottenthis far that a lot of other people don't bring because i've trusted everybody i've given everybodythe benefit of the doubt over the last four and a half years and been bitten most of the timeJames Giordano is a gift that doesn't stop giving though i can just keep watching videos of himand he says things that are worth millions of dollars and so this is no different this has beena great stream so far by various actors and agents who may have capricious if not nefarious intentbut i think it's also important to understand that these different cultures different countriesbring to the table different histories different needs different values differentphilosophies and very often those histories are long-standing and these philosophies anthropologiesand values established distinct ethics and those ethics may be far more permissive than we whoeverwe may be would like and in other cases it affords opportunities for things like research tourismcan't get it done here go there well what does that mean is that ethics dumping or is that simplyethical heterogeneity but clearly what it does is it reestablishes the capability for leveragingthe brain sciences in ways that can be used in multinational relations that range from theeconomic as i said earlier all the way to the bellicose wow i mean he's just saying it withoutsaying it we could work together to screw people over if we wanted to and maybe we will with agroup of non-state actors and state actors and state proxies and non-state proxies he said it rightthere we could in 2022 he's saying oh boy i mean really it's becoming easier much of the neuroscience is shared in international form and i'm not making any proposition to decrease that but ithink there is a need for increased responsible conductive research inclusive of its disseminationand sharing to be able to understand what's being shared and how it might be used not very differentthan the the the advocating for a control on gain of function research because we don't know whatthey're doing and we don't want them sharing it with everybody there are a number of tools andmethods that are available off the shelf and as i mentioned previously there are dedicated effortsby nations and nations and their proxies towards not only developing these capabilities in brainsciences that could be weaponized but actually putting them into play as as recent evidence wouldshow case in point such things like novichuk the use of a variety of organic toxins and thestill somewhat controversial consideration of the use of various types of neurologicallydirected energies so i think it becomes important to recognize that these things are ready forprimetime the technological readiness level has been indeed acknowledged and appreciated by anumber of worldwide groups not only ours working with the brain project health organization unescomost recently nato the national academies here in the united i mean what nato unescothe united nations world health organization can you list any other bad guys that we would rathernot cooperate with like holy s*** on a shingle it's been indeed acknowledged and appreciated by anumber of worldwide groups not only ours working with the brain project health organization unescomost recently nato the national academies here in the united states national research councilall of them recognizing the viability potential bellicose value and realities of neuroscienceand technology as tools what does bellicose value mean does that mean that it can hurt people orit can be really loud and obnoxious what does he mean by that he said bellicose too often to i can'tignore it anymore warfare intelligence in that havana syndrome could be legit but don't think ofit as mind control think of it as maybe they can send a a focused beam of energy into somebody'sbrain and it can hurt them i mean is it would it be strange if they could make a commercialsized microwave and focus it on on a on a room that it would bother your brain would that wouldthat surprise you at all that's not the same as remote control and he can say all these bigwords but you know if they have a microwave gun that can kill neurons with heating that's not avery fancy technology that's not very special and you could call it neuro something somethingbut it's in reality it's a microwave beam i mean and that's where i think this stuff getsdistorted i think that's what this guy's job is is to imply that chemicals toxins and focused energyare equivalent to ai control read writing in the brain and and behavioral modification on a massscale it's not the same one doesn't imply the existence of the other but he is very capableof his of of enchanting his listeners so that those are considered all part of the same thingsome of the more recent discourse for example by the nuffield council some of the work of ourgroup not only with the human brain project but with others have addressed those ways thatwe might be able to surveil and oversee these initiatives and agendas but there is also asticking point if one of the recommendations and i think perhaps a viable recommendationis that the brain sciences shall not be uptaken into those agendas explicitly by those countrieswho would sort of embargo or push back on these intents we have to appreciate not only what thatdoes idiosyncratically within a country or a community but what are the benefits if notburdens risks and perhaps threats systemically because a lack of commitment to neuroscientifictechnological research development testing does not in any way preclude others research and iwould argue dude for peace that actually the people that push the the human genome project are alsofaked until we make it salesman i would say that the people that pushed the viral causes of of chronicchronic fatigue syndrome are fake it till we make it salesman that mark actually identified a prejudy mikovitz make it fake it till you make it salesman on the exact same subject that actuallytrained under hillary koprowski fake it till you make it has become something that our kids thinkis how adults do it it's not how i did it it's not how my dad did it it's not how my grandma didit's not how my grandparents did it but somehow or another this culture has kind of taken overwe're not faking it until we make it we were a biologist i was a biologist with a 20 year careerin neurobiology that kind of snuck through a Nobel prize winning lab in 2014 i mean i'm not i'm notanyone without a cv i'm an absolute legitimate biologist bringing legitimate questions to thefloor about this stuff and being ignored for four years being misled for four years being beingplayed with for four years and i'm mad about it because i think they're after our kids and they'reafter our grandkids and and very few people seem to be mad enough about it to do anything soi'm trying to bring that biology out and i think that james diordano is a wonderful background onwhich to bring it out because this is a fake it until you make it thing and they have fakedbiosecurity and bioterrorism and pandemics they have faked it until they made itthey faked all of that stuff that potential they faked it and then they made itand now they've got to double down on the fake otherwise they won't have made it where they'vealready made it you see this is it right here they have to stick to it the coordinated harmonizinglies must be respected otherwise the whole illusion falls apart and the since the illusion goes backnot to 2020 the illusion goes back all the way to the special cancer virus programwhen they thought that they could irradiate things to increase the speed of evolutionwhen they were all one departmentdevelopment testing and perhaps application and translational use initiatives in some casesmay augment it and this gets us to the difficulty of global sureconventions Helsinki biological toxins and weapons conventions are having a difficult time dealing withsome of these non-conventional techniques and technologies very often international treatiesdon't necessarily guarantee cooperation but more than that the extant verbiage of many of thesetreaties has only begun to scrape the surface as to the categorical diversity of the way theseneuroscientific truths and technology I would rather say that what AI and large language modelshave done and should have done for us is to reveal that language itself is an illusionlanguage itself is a sort of limited spectrum of ideas and the more we allow the precisionof our language to be reduced from a college level to a 12th grade level to an eighth gradelevel to a sixth grade level we have the inability to express ourselves the inability to express ourreverence for that which we can't understand because we are now trapped not only in a limitedspectrum of ideas but a limited spectrum of words with which to juggle those ideasand so large language models if they've exposed anything for me they've exposed the fact that languageis part of the way that they got us they dumbed us down we don't talk the way that they used totalk at the start of the ninth of the 20th century just go and look for yourself after this streamfor a speech when ronald reagan was still running for office as the governor ofcalifornia and you will find a level of language that's simply not found on television anymoreyou will find a level of sophisticated discussion about fine points and details and humor that youwon't find in any political speech ever again in america if they have their wayand that's for me what large language models have shown me is that the more the less words wehave to play with the more simple it is to make shit up to lie about it and to distort the truthwithin this limited spectrum of debate that is also reinforced by this limited spectrum ofvocabulary and concepts it's extraordinary to me great commentologies could be developed inuse the btwc and cwc don't explicitly prohibit medical use occupational preventive medical usecommercial or proprietary use in the development of particular tools and technologiesthat can be employed in commercial testing inclusive of commercial testing for exampleof organic materials to assess their vulnerability in the workspace in some cases the researchdevelopment test evaluation and use of neuro technologies is latter point was specificallyaddressed by the australia delegation the australia group at the review conference of the biologicaltoxins and weapons conventions a couple of years ago and so this is coming to the foreincreasingly and i'm encouraged by that but i think that we're really facing here is thatneuroscience and technology can be likened to an international super speedway a formula one racemultiple lanes multiple vehicles a very very high technological prowess and capability a rapid pacerelatively big prizes now what i would suggest is that a very similar story is that bird too loudthat robin is going bananas um a very similar story has been told about ai and the biologicalspace let's say the biological reality in that and hear hear me out for a second that chinahas been collecting medical data and genetic data from their more homogenous population geneticallyfor a longer time than we have and so if he was to tell a story in a secret meeting what he wouldsay is america we are so far behind because this is a race and the chinese because of their systembecause of their totalitarian control the uk because of their their their nationalized medicalsystem the and and israel because of their nationalized medical system because of certaindatabases in the united states we have the opportunity to catch up and if we don't if wecontinue to ignore this race we will fall behind forever and the only way we're going to catch upis to do something drastic and that might include orchestrating a pandemic to make sure that thesovereignty that americans consider their own is permanently erased by an emergency a crisis thatwe all agree happens that we all agree could happen again and so we can catch up in this racejust consider that a possibility remember i'm calling the cops i don't know why the criminalsare doing what they're doing and i don't have a good explanation because i ain't them i don'thave a copy of the plan but there's lots of good explanations that are right in front of our facethat don't involve magic tricks that don't involve you know secret technology they just involvea wonderfully orchestrated coordinated harmonized list of lies again that range from the financialall the way to global hegemony's and the ability to influence and exert forces in a variety ofdifferent domains again from the economic to the bellicose and there are risks and hazards risksand hazards that are inherent to the technology and those that are derived from his various usesand military operations although very often exist with some level of limited transparencyin an open society must have some level of responsibility and communication to the publicthat it vows to protect the question then becomes if we're going to enter the race and we alreadyhave are there race rules and or restrictions well our group working together with others herein the united states and internationally have proposed if you're going to get on the racetrackyou need some rules to get on the ramp you propose something called the on ramp approachan operational and neuro technology risk assessment and mitigation paradigm and i providethose references for you writ large and over it involves a general six r approach that then drillsdown into specific questions that must be asked i would argue this is stupid complicated you'remaking questions about ethics about personal and individual sovereignty sovereignty over childrensovereignty over data sovereignty over medical data sovereignty over genetics and sovereignty overyour grandchildren as being irrelevant and breaking down into a lot of big words and a lot of subtextthat actually just completely sidesteps the idea that we have any sovereignty over ourselves orany sovereignty over our future any sovereignty over our children and and that's what's happeninghere i see just an enchantment and this might be an enchantment aimed at people that are alreadywithin the bureaucracy that already understand and have been at secret meetings before and so canfill in some of the blanks that you and i can't but one of the blanks here is kind of a lookawaydoctrine we know that that military and and government intelligence agencies often functionon a lookaway doctrine if you don't know what's going on in that room and you don't have to askany questions then what does it matter and so again that's just the tip of the iceberg of what isnot being said here but what is being said is that we're going to obfuscate the simple ethicalideas of informed consent and sovereignty by never using those words by never talking aboutthose things how can he be an ethicist he's no different than than tony fouchi's wife who cangive an entire talk about bioethics without ever once saying informed consent and here we haveanother person who parades himself as being a bioethicist but never ever says informed consenteven robert malone says he's actually a bioethicist but in all that bioethics in running through hisveins he's never bothered to explain that transfection was always criminally negligent and healthyhumans it should have never been given to children he sat on a beach and kind of made it a gray areaas to whether kids should take it or not which also of course was an admission or an implicationthat adults and old people sure they should take it they're at more danger of covid than you arebarefoot on a beach it's all part of the same coordinated lying he has probably been in a fewmeetings with james giordano at one point or another in his illustrious career serving thisglobal governance weaponized pile of money structure once you see them ladies and gentlemen it'syou can't unsee them and that's what we're doing here one by one people are going to come to seeit they're going to pull their head out of this box where all these people are telling these loudstories about what they did selling an ivermectin book selling a book about lies my government toldme publishing a book about the covid virus and in the beginning of the pandemic but not reallypublishing it anywhere else not really pushing it at all it's all lies ladies and gentlemen they'reall liars working for one nonprofit that's supposedly fighting for for autistic kids aroundthe world and then starting another profit that's non-profit that's supposed to fight the who and allthe while years and years later nobody's even mentioned the prep act or strict liability or theseventh amendment violation that the prep acts sub subtext represents years and years and nowwe're on to our second second non-profit fighting the who and still we're not saying that it'sessentially just the criminal vaccine schedule that they're protecting essentially just the ideathat we have defeated disease with vaccines that they're protecting that none of them actuallyquestion robert malone maryl nass i mean they none of them question it who else doesn't questionit brett weinstein his wife peter teal eric weinstein jordan peterson who else doesn't questionit does do any of them usefully question it or do they talk about free speech randomized controltrials and not say strict liability not say strike the prep act not say seventh amendment violationnone of them do none of them that have had much longer than the pandemic to figure it outmaryl nass could have pulled her head out and said at any time she wanted to in the last 10 yearsthat she's been taking money from this opposition she could have just said that the vaccine scheduleamerica's criminal just compared to any other country and that's where we should start she couldhave said it she hasn't anyone there could have said it they haven't question very clearly find avideo where one of these people has said it the united states vaccine schedule is criminal compareit to another country they haven't said it they've said that the mandates are wrong that censoringpeople on the internet is wrong health freedom is right it's all part of the same coordinatedharmonized list of lies where none of them step on each other's toes where all of them pretend to stopone part of the train but none of them get in each other's way so it looks really convincingand key context of framing that must be appreciated it demands responsibility for realisticassessment of the technology not science fiction there are plenty of real things that need to beaddressed reviewed and in some cases guided evaluating research and viable uses in practice whatconstitutes dual use research of concern what does not what constitutes gain of function researchof concern and what does not responsive to the burdens and effects not only idiosyncraticallyamong individuals and collectives but perhaps systemically as well given certain harms of omissionor conish we're advising that it's two hours i think i'm gonna leave it here and maybe i'llwatch some of this at double speed and see if there's anything worth pulling out as highlightsi don't want to make this video too long and i don't want to test pier tube's ability to put itup i'm gonna see if i can get two hours again um for the 72 people who have joined me this morningon this uh show thank you very much for being here thank you very much for taking the time toshare my work and to be here and participate in the chat i'm getting better at being able to readthe chat quick see if there's anything worth commenting about and then going on and so pleasekeep coming please keep typing please keep sending the emails um it's all gonna get better and betterand better um in this month um because it has to because my family needs to make this work i needto make this work and i really believe this is what i'm supposed to be doing so thank you very muchlook forward to um some more broken science initiative content um matt briggs has been workinghard to start to put a general um big picture of probability course together and i've beendiligently following along and listening and trying to figure out how i can help or summarize oror maybe recap some of the stuff that he's doing um and i think he's kind of learning as he goes tobecause this is a course that he hasn't you know already outlined from the beginning to the endbut it's kind of improvising his way through it and i think that was what also makes it a littlemore entertaining um so you can find those on twitter if you haven't found them already um andother than that i guess i would say thank you very much for joining me and uh we will be here againfaithfully um tomorrow uh and i guess i'll put this one up as the last slideum did that work yes although my computer is cranking like it's not very happyi don't know what happened there uh ladies and gentlemen thank you very much uh for being herethank you very much for participating and i will definitely see you tomorrow again at 1010i'm gonna try to get sharper and sharper and sharper the actual goal in terms of 1010 is tostart the music and the slideshow or some other placeholder at 10 o'clock so that i'm really sharpat 1010 um and you don't necessarily need to watch the whole introduction to get there at 1010so that the people who are necessarily are frustrated with the show starting and then havinga four or five minute introduction won't need to be as frustrated um thank you very very very veryvery very very very much um it's really encouraging um and thank you again for for sharing my workand i'll see you again tomorrowwe're gonna summarize that stuff that we've learned about virology and prions and thenin the coming week or so um and we'll put together a succinct slide set uh that's kind of an updateto the old maximum slide set um and and we've been falling way behind on slide sets um and somay is the the month where that's gonna start again um it is a little more work for me in the sense ofi've got to be ahead of myself and and have two decks i have to have this deck um and then i haveto have the deck that could be made into a pdf because as you can imagine with all the movingnonsense and with all the extra stuff that's on these decks making a pdf of this deck is notreally useful um it becomes a giant document with a lot of moving parts that aren't all embedded andso i have to make a separate deck that summarizes the deck that i use and so anyway um we need todo a prions deck we need to do a virology deck we need to do an immunology deck and we need to do aRNA cannot pandemic summary deck um and so those are all little mini courses um that's what i'vebeen trying to threaten is a mini course um and so these videos and these study halls have allbeen preparation for that mini course and in the background um i have actually been assemblingfor example um i've been assembling prion reviews and um all the papers that i want to use in thecoming courses um we have prions and we have a couple other things in there um that we need tolearn we need to know what these words mean like amyloidosis and prionogenesis and what they don'tmean so that we can understand when we're being bamboozled and when we aren't so again thank youvery much and i'll see you again soonyouyouyouyou[BLANK_AUDIO]
