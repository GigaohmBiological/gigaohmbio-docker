I have lied, I'm sure I'll lie again.I don't want to lie, you know, I don't think I'm a liar.I try not to be a liar, I don't want to be a liar.I think it's like really important.I'm only streaming on Twitch right now in case you're trying to find me somewhere else.Everything else crashed out.I got to do some IT juggling in the background to figure out what's wrong with my stream keys or whatever is going on.So I apologize for that.I'm not sure exactly who he is.His name is JJ Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.You're still there, Christy, and can tell me what video you're talking about.I hope it's not on Twitch.I hope Twitch is at least solid if anybody else can confirm that one more time.That would be wonderful.Thank you very much for being here.Hello, Pamela.Hello, everyone.[Cricket Chirp][Music][Music]I'm afraid you're right.I'm afraid Info Wars has finally transitioned to being part of the CNN in this new world.Just like they're trying to transition Brett Weinstein and Joe Rogan into being more what we would be considered mainstream sources of information.Of course, they're no better than any other pre-purchased performer.And once you realize that we're talking about weaponized piles of money behind these people,you start to get the feeling that there's just a team that we haven't been aware of you could play for.And if you were offered a spot on that team, you might take it too.That's really, you know, four years ago it might have been different than now too.And you can't back out of that team.And because your consciousness is the prime real estate that they are all competing for,yeah, you got to be well aware of the fact that they are happy.My friend in Berg mixed up.They are happy, happy to have us attribute bad motives to the people that we disagree with.Because the people that we disagree with are taking positions that they themselves have curated.That they themselves have set up as strawmen that we feel compelled to defend because there's an illusion of consensus on TV and social mediathat these are the relevant topics and the relevant questions to ask.And that people who don't want to ask these questions just to have bad motives,that's why they don't want to answer to these questions.And that is why they don't want you talking about how fractional reserve banking works.That's why they don't teach you in high school.They never taught us in high school where a mortgage comes from.And there are just some people also unfortunately who are never going to see even when they are shown.And that part of the debate may be what Matthias Desmond is talking about with regard to mass psychosis,the people who can't see and will never see.But for me it's very clear that in history they only have one chance to pull off the heist,one chance to collect the data and they've been talking about it for a while.They've been doing presentations for each other in private meetings about how there is an opportunity herethat in addition to the smart thing of reducing population on earth to a more sustainable levelso that we can all be rich and we can all have all the amenities of modern life,it would be wise to reduce population but let's not ignore the opportunity herethat 10 billion people on the planet if we have our way will never exist againand so we better dang well collect that data now.And I think you can find evidence for this impetus and this motivation in historyand I think one of the best people to follow with regard to just you knowlooking at this history from different angles and through different perspectivesfrom the perspective of the people involved in it.I think Mark Huzatonic is Mark Huzatonic, ITS Mark Kulak is actually a really great person to follow.He's one of those people fighting to take the power back from these charlatans right here.Pamela in the chat has been trying to take back the power from these charlatans for a long time,has been trying to make gentle the life of this world for a long time.And I feel quite honored actually to have her in my corner.I've never met her but I've put a PI on her once and I know that she's not a liar.And I don't like liars ladies and gentlemen.I think the reason why we have had so much trouble surfing this waveis because of the tremendous number of liars.And once we've found the truth now we have to pass it on to other humanoids.We have to pass it on to our children, to our neighbors, to our friends, to the teachers union, to the coffee break people.I don't know what I was going to say there but we've got to start passing this truth onso that more people can surf their way out of this.And yeah, if you've been here for a while you know exactly what I'm talking about when I say we have to stay focused on the biology.We don't want to take the bait on TV and social media and we need to love our neighbors before we're going to get out of this.Thank you very much for sharing the work. Thank you very much for supporting the work.That's how this works.We need more and more people to learn this biology and wake up.[Music]Yes, we need to wake up ladies and gentlemen.We need to wake up and we need to identify the people who have been lying to us for a while.Some people are not comfortable with the word lie but then what do you want me to say?That there's classified information that they've not told us in order that they could govern usand that some of that classified information when they don't tell it to us is effectively a lie.If they know things about like for example the gain of function virology in RNA viruses is a myth and there,but it's a classified myth then they have to lie about it.Don't you understand? Even if you don't want to think about that as a lie, that's how you are participating in this.You're keeping your hand over your eyes and ignoring the fact that we are governed by lies and by liars.That's just the way it is. It's always been that way. They don't always tell us the truth.Now the question becomes what if they've been lying to us about our biology?What if they've been lying to us about public health?What if they have been lying to us about all the threats that exist out there in the world,especially with regard to biological threats in order to be able to govern us by a mythologythat we have absolutely no control over? Ladies and gentlemen, may the fourth be with you.This is one of those days when people make lots of jokes about Star Wars and so I thought I would too.Again, good morning. This is Gigawome Biological.[mhwylwch]Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is May the 4th, 2024. This is Gigawome Biological,a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's Saturday. It's 10.58. It's almost 11 in the morning.My two boys have just gone to the gym with their mom and they're going to do another hour of ball handling drills and shooting.This week, my boys, both at one day apart, managed to hit the milestone at this gym faster than anyone has ever hit it before.They made 10,000 shots. They both taken over 16,000 shots in the last two months over March and April.They crossed the threshold of making 10,000 shots on the machine,which kind of blows my mind, but when I play King of the Court with them now and if I don't cheat and block their shot because I'm a giant and let them shoot over my head,I can meet some pretty decent competition and my little boy has quite the step.If he gets my legs twisted up, the kid can get a layup and he was not able to do that last year.What I'm really excited to share that personal thing is that I really, I think one of the best things that we can impart on our children is the lesson that the time that you put in and how hard you try at anything over time will pay off.It's very hard nowadays to get children to engage in something long enough so that they can see that engaging in it is producing results.On the flip side of that, there are things that my kids do that are not growing well enough so that they're starting to lose interest in it.One of the best examples is my 12-year-old plays trombone.At first he didn't want to do an instrument and then he played trombone a few months and he realized, "Wow, this is a really powerful instrument and it's freaking fun."Then he got good at it and then they had a concert and now the challenge of it is not increasing.The music isn't getting that much harder because it's still a pretty big band and he's still pretty young.He's starting to think, "Maybe I don't want to do it anymore because I don't really have to try very hard and I don't really like being the best trombone player among people that don't really like to play either."If my friend wouldn't have quit last year, you know that whole thing.I was just really worried for him especially because the other one had played football and played basketball and played soccer one time or another.I was just worried that the kid wouldn't find something where he would learn this lesson that how much you can get out of daily dedication to a skill.Daily dedication to exercise is also there but daily dedication to skill is something so amazing.The only reason why I can't do more on the piano that's in front of me is because it's a half-sized keyboard and I have giant hands.Learning to play jump on the keyboard, I had it said at the wrong thing, down here is really hard.The piano upstairs of the keyboard that my daughter has upstairs is much easier because it's bigger.The skills that I learned, those are from years and years ago and they're still there because for a little while I practiced piano pretty seriously.I thought it was pretty cool and I learned to play Star Wars on it and a bunch of other stuff that motivated me.Then at some point I went on to the saxophone and other things but music has always been a thing.I just wanted my kids to find something and then they found basketball and I thought we would go like three times a week.I crap you not. We have only missed two days. The Saturday and the Sunday of Easter Sunday.That weekend we took two days off because they went to stay overnight at somebody's house or whatever.Other than that they've also had me in the gym shooting and moving around every day which has been extraordinary because I'm spending almost two hours a day with my sons that I wasn't spending with them before.Doing something that I myself wanted to do but never really wanted to be so selfish as to force on them and now they're pretty obsessed with it.Maybe the first hopeful message, at least from my own perspective, is that I can honestly say that the change in my life from dedicating so much time and energy to trying to perform well as a professorin a university setting and get a grant or get the data that I didn't get yesterday or submit that whatever has been amazing.After four years of trying to figure out how to get my head on straight, really the best thing about the pandemic for me and maybe the best thing about the pandemic for you that you haven't reflected on is that it has made you realize what really is important.Who really is important and perhaps some of you have been lucky enough to reorient your lives in such a way so that some of those things that should have had more time and priority now do.And so if you can look at it that way try to think about okay well how can I make this even better how can I how can I even double down on this before and I'm kind of circling back to a talk that I did.I've done a few times a little secret talk that I've sometimes inserted at the end of shows. I don't know what the next slide is let me just make sure I know what I'm expecting here, because I'm improvising right now this is not what I plan to talk about.Oh yeah, I'll just start with that first.A muskular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb. Transfection healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.I will ever need me to do a zoom presentation, a 30,000 foot level survey course with some citations maybe some basic hints on where to start reading and some cartoons, and you want me to do it for your teachers union or for your family group or or whatever.Please just send me an email and and and will work something out because I think this main message needs to be challenged I want somebody to take me to task on it.I want somebody to tell me why I shouldn't be saying these words, so that I can correct them because I do think if this is not as sharp as the knife can get that I want it to become sharper and so that's first and foremost the message the next message that I wanted to send out.Was one that comes from the patch clamp perspective so yesterday I kind of got off on a tangent about the work that I did with regard to small conductance calcium activated potassium channels.And all the work that I did with inside outside inside out and outside out patches, and how the conductance of these channels has been studied in so many in vitro preparations that to doubt them is is is silly to to say that they are the sum total of what we are of course would also be silly.But it would be like saying that we, we, we understand how a light bulb works, but we don't understand how the whole power grid works and then having somebody say you don't know anything about light bulbs.Well yeah, I do.I don't know how the power is generated and how it's distributed to my house and everybody else's house with no interruption, but I can tell you how a light bulb works.And in this case, I think we can say how ion channels work at least we have a good idea we might be wrong about some of the very subtle details of the, how the physics sorts out at the gating mechanism or something like that but we, we, we have a pretty good idea we've tested those very very rigorously relative to for example how the cytopathic effect in in a zero six cell culture has been rigorously tested to see that the cartoon version of the light bulb works.The cartoon version of it some of what reflects the the nature of reality and that that's not they've not they've not tested that at all.Since the 40s or the 50s when this became kind of the norm or the standard if you will, that standard has never been challenged or tried to be increased in fidelity.And they're still using plaque assays is the primary way to sort this stuff out even though we are supposedly have nano poor sequencing and this guy from Harvard was sharing some kind of nano particle reading chips with the with the Chinese back before the pandemic started for $55,000 a year but we still have to do plaque assays to understand what's going on in a viral culture.I mean that's just crazy.So, the good message that I wanted to bring is that I woke up the other day and realized that I had a revelation in the Netherlands that I still hadn't applied to my life here.That reality that that revelation was in the Netherlands that I had was that I had been. I had been obsessed with optimizing my experimental protocol and my procedure in terms of getting through the day how I spent my time so that I could get home on time so that I could get work done at the lab, not short change the mouse because if you kill a mouse, and you could, you could record.Let's just say you could record 20 hours and you don't that's pretty lame now you can't record 20 hours but you can record eight.If it's good.And so you want to kind of set yourself up so that if you have it and you you're getting great data and all the tissue is healthy and the recordings are stable and you know there's no wind and the you know whatever voodoo happens in these things because it is voodoo when you're making a stack of cards every day.That's what really hard experiments are the mouse has to cooperate.You can't run out of carbogen too early.You know the ice should be the right you know whatever the you have to make sure you tighten the razor right and if the razor is loose you might have a bad slice.There's lots of random things that could happen in the course of the three hour preparation before you start this potentially eight hours of recording that the more optimized the preparation was the more likely you were to get to the best place possible to start experiments with the most consistent outcome.And what I've been explaining to my boys with regard to basketball is it's pretty hard to play a sport or an athletic thing half speed.You either kind of have to try and replicate 95 or 90% as hard as you can and try to hit that repeatedly because that you can kind of reach because you know what it's like when you're trying as hard as you can.But it's pretty hard to do it half speed or with half jump or with half follow through in order to practice or relax you're much better off going full speed and then resting.Then you are trying to go half speed for a whole game and in fact that's a terrible habit to get into because then you're practicing somewhere between 40 and 60% instead of practicing at 95% all the time.And so with regard to science, there are a lot of scientists who think that well that the slices are okay today so I'll do the recordings and then they create this this data set which is essentially contaminated with imperfect experimental settings that weren't soregularously controlled that you got to the same place at the starting point every time. And if you're not hyper anal about that if you're not sensitive to exactly what it is that indicates that you're at that acceptably perfect starting point, then you're also open to the possibility that your whole data set will have this noise in it.That's created by your inability to keep your experimental starting point at the same place and so this is one of the most beautiful reasons why infectious clones for RNA viruses are so important because there would be no other way for any of these experiments to start in the same place.My experiments would start in the same place because I would start with the same mouse line which are genetically inbred so identical to one another. I would start with them in the same age week.I would never use an animal that was older than 36 days or younger than 27 so I was technically adult, but young enough so that I could still make my prep. And most of the time I tried to keep that window even lower and I definitely kept track of that window so that I could analyze whether there was a difference between the ages.And so the amount of cognitive energy that you would need, I would need to spend every day just to keep this dance in order so that I showed up and I didn't get distracted by email and I didn't get distracted by a student and I knew where I needed to be at 11 o'clock so that at 1215 I was done eating and I could start on the rig.And all this energy I spent optimizing my day at work I never spent a dime of my brain trying to optimize my Saturday. I've never spent a dime trying to optimize my Sunday.And why? Because I didn't have a motivation to optimize it. What was my motivation? I was done with work. All I wanted was Saturday. All I wanted was Sunday for me and to be free.But a strategy that comes from a patch clamper where you're trying to optimize your day at work can be applied to optimizing your Saturday and optimizing your Sunday so that you hit all the marks. And there's absolutely nothing wrong. In fact, there is a good way, that's a good way to keep the news and social media and all of this distraction machinery from actually taking hold of your brain having a plan and optimizing it for every day.And not in a robotic way but in just kind of like how'd that go today. Did I manage to check that box and today I want to just shout out to the fact that my sons and their dedication to basketball has reminded me again that there is an optimizing to be done which is actually happening right now when we're starting at 1010 and trying to come on every day and trying to do the studying in the afternoon so that I can think about it after dinner and be ready to do what I want to do in the morning without having to do that.So, it's really a wonderful thing to think about the pandemic shake up, which is going to be and remains in the future inevitable you know they're going to do it you know that that ghostbusters energy that we were talking about the beginning is not.It's not something we're imagining. So we know that the ground is going to become unstable.And so I think we should plan to take advantage of it you know if you know that there's going to be a flood and you can buy a little rowboat right now or, or something like that then why wouldn't you.And if you know that there's going to be a little bit of a shake up right now let's start to think about trying to identify what it is that when that shake up happens or when we start to feel it ourselves that those priorities we already know what they are.And, and the things that we want to optimize our activity around we already know what they are maybe we're already busy with it.And so for me.I am really focused constantly on trying to optimize my contribution to my family, and to my marriage with the absolute drive that I have to be here every day and I think it's it's starting to work.I think it's really starting to work and so I'm really excited about it and I think there's something there for everybody I don't know really how else to say it but I used to optimize my day at work every day.And obsessed about it 24/7 and I think I want to try to encourage everybody to try and optimize their own day but in a way that's oriented around you and your family and those priorities not around work, even though work obviously at one point in time in this in thisuniverse was okay for work to be something that took that priority.I think for a lot of us if not for almost all of us now work is really a means to an end in nothing more.That's part of the scary part of the future coming forward those of us who are still blessed to feel like we're doing what we're supposed to be doing which, you know, I humbly saying, it's me.I definitely feel like I'm doing what I'm doing and I'm blessed to be able to do it.But it's because I have the wife I have because I have the kids I have because I have the neighbors I have and the friends I have it's not the family.Unfortunately for me, like some of us, you know the family was was fractured on this idea.And so I've got a lot to fight for to actually found out that my parents are thinking about coming to visit in Pittsburgh in two weeks so that could be an interesting interesting wrench in the works.We'll see if we can, we can figure out some amends there.I already said this again, if you need any help, or you want me to try and explain this every once in a while I'm going to do a show about these three things it's been a while since I've done that but I haven't I won't do it right now.Today, I want to again, take this video or take this time to watch this video that was made sometime last year that was supposed to respond to my email, which I was asked to write to Christine Massey and Tom Cowan and Andy Kaufman, and I don't know who else was on the email, but Mary Holland of Children's Health Defense that I think at the time may have still been working withthe Kennedy campaign, because she came back from the Kennedy campaign a month after I started working at CHD and before that, she was actually, you know, some kind of pretty, pretty significant player in in RFK's campaign and then she came back to CHD a month after I started.Anyway, Mary Holland before I started at CHD while I was still working for as a consultant for the Wuhan cover up book.She asked me to write a letter an email on behalf and try to explain to them why no virus wasn't a very good position and I wrote an email which I guess I could try to find right now I think I tried to find it once and I had some kind of problem finding it it's not that I don't have it it said I don't have access to all the email I used to since they fired me, or laid me off or ended my position whatever they called it.I want to look for that one.I saidI just read this one to you maybe I'll put it up on the screen to my own focus again.I'm just a, I don't want to get. Maybe I can copy this.And stuff so I, I mean just, I can do this quick.Okay, so I, I wrote this on request of Mary Holland as an email to the people who I don't sorry I don't have this setup. I didn't think I was going to do this again I improvise a lot you just might not know that, but I do.Here we go.I'm just trying to get them to to admit or chd to get them to admit that there's no virus and why does chd keep saying there's a virus when there's no virus. Okay, so when I wrote this I was still not where I am now I was still not where I am now that's about the best I can say so just I'll read this and then you can, you can, you can hear it so there's no question that thevirus, biology and virology in general are amongst the most tenuous fields in biology in a world where viruses exist but everyone involved has both exaggerated their ability to identify and study viruses and underplay the danger of synthetic infectious RNA clones.The most important thing is to move slowly. It is in virologist best interest that we never figure out the extent of their exaggerations infectious clones are at best poor approximations of coronavirus is in our synthetic infectious constructs that allow controlled experiments to be conducted.Coronavirus is exist as semi stable quasi species which could be wrong. That could be wrong.Man, synthetic infectious constructs which allow controlled experiments to be conducted. Coronavirus is exist as semi stable quasi species in nature and are largely benign genetic noise especially in healthy mammalian populations.Sorry I had to fix that camera. That should be all right.And are largely benign genetic noise so that's good especially in healthy mammal populations and so you can see I'm still not saying that they're just exosomes but I'm trying to express the idea that the story that we've been told is greatly exaggerated and thatmight be sufficient. That might be sufficient. I don't know why I'm so pixelated. It's kind of annoying to me what's going on here. This whole business is is movie.And so benign genetic noise especially in healthy mammal populations at worse infectious clones found in laboratories all over the world represent a purity level of a biological agent that would otherwise never exist.And if manufactured to quantity represent a significant potential danger with untold potential possible consequences. But this danger is obviously man made an absent in nature and gain a function as a boogeyman is distracting us from this fact.Can you hear this how good it is. Furthermore synthetic biology allows for the directed selection of optimized molecules and even short immunogenic sequences that when inserted into a synthetic infectious RNA could create a new and as yet undescribeddanger however even then it would only be in a pure quantity than any such agent would pose a potential threat to many thousands of people. The idea of a natural yet novel coronavirus posing a threat to millions of people is a myth because of the dynamic nature of RNA viruses and on this we agree.However a pure infectious clone of even an endemic human coronavirus OC 43 made to a quantity of thousands of leaders might pose a threat such an event intentional or accidental would result in a situation where even a nonspecific PCR diagnostic could appear to be rather accurate for a time.While we agree that there have been many many lies during COVID we believe that the situation is complicated and that the no virus stance lacks sufficient nuance to be the most viable position.I'm not sure that's such a bad statement especially at the time that it was made.Well this is driving me nuts but I really feel like this is not in focus so I am going to put it in focus one more time sorry about that guys.So weird so many glitches today so many glitches and there I'm out of focus again.Just don't know what's up with OBS is something is wrong with my my business here will figure it out though it's no problem.I just I look pixelated do I look pixelated to you to because that's not how I should look and I bet I don't look and then it goes away on this screen see.Something is goofy with this GoPro sometimes I think or no wait it should have been on the other one not on this one.That's bad news bears is what that is I don't get that at all OK I'll figure that out later look fine to me not pixelated alright.So anyway the point is is that this video that we're going to watch wow are we going to watch it anytime soon 38 minutes in the video that we're going to watch is a response to this.OK that's the thing this is the video is a response to this email and so that's that's pretty it should be pretty revealing then OK.Might be loud at the beginning so I hope all the joys I'll put it down right now actually just a second to make sure it's not too loud.Hey everyone the purpose of this video is to address a few recent statements made by JJ Cooey.The clips will play during this video come from a recent Twitch stream put on by JJ as well as a recent podcast that JJ appeared in as a guest.According to JJ's LinkedIn he is a teacher a biologist and the founder of gigaome biological given that JJ is frequently promoted by that's nice because actually very few people Brett Weinstein has never said gigaome biological out loud so already at least Alex is not a complete creep.Very few people have said gigaome biological out loud maybe it's a big couple of words but it's surprising actually it's a fairly nice shout out so that's OK with me.A leading voices in the health freedom movement.You felt that it was necessary to respond to JJ statements regardless.How can somebody with 3000 followers on Twitch and at the time less than 10,000 followers on Twitter be a significant person in the what in the hell kind of stupid statement is that.Wow that is bad.You'll come from a recent Twitch stream put on by JJ as well as a recent podcast that JJ appeared in as a guest.According to JJ's LinkedIn he is a teacher a biologist and the founder of gigaome biological given that JJ is frequently promoted by leading voices in the health freedom movement.You felt that it was necessary to respond to JJ statements regarding the no virus position his mischaracterization of prominent voices in the no virus camp and his questioning of the motives of those who are communicating the lack of true scientific validation for virology.This video we put together is also a perfect opportunity to address some common misconceptions for those who are still undecided about the validity of virology or lack thereof.We look forward to hearing from JJ and having further discussions on this issue.I didn't know that.I didn't enjoy the video.This is just downloaded from right.Right.Thanks everybody for joining us.I think you can see all the panelists that we've amassed today.And before we get started, because what we're going to do is look at some of the comments that a.I'm not sure exactly who he is.His name is JJ Cooey.And I believe he's a consultant for CHD.And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.So that's that's what I get it.I that's what I'm using in the in the beginning all the time.I'm going to put this just a little faster because this is pretty slow.But I really wanted to preface this event with is this has been, I think for all of us, I'll speak for myself, but I may be able to speak for the rest of us.A kind of bizarre and frustrating few years.And I've often asked myself, why has this been so frustrating and so difficult to have a conversation that resolves the questions around virology?Why has it been so difficult to come to any agreements between quote both sides?And I think there's actually a very simple answer to that.And that is when you look at the the central issue, which is what we talk about, which is, is there evidence or proof that these so called pathogenic viruses actually exist?Now, the interesting thing, and I know we've talked about this a lot, but I'm not sure people completely appreciate this is that the way to answer that question is extremely clear.The way you you should do it is you make a essentially a definition of what you're looking for, which we have, you know, a replication, competent protein code genetic interior that replicates in living cells.And you go look for that in various quote infected animal plant or human tissue.That's the way we look for most things.Now we all know and we all agree that and Christine knows this better than anybody because we have hundreds now of of answers from institutions saying using that simple method, none of these particles have ever been found.And again, it's very clear that nobody disputes that.I mean, think of it another way right?Supposedly, he amassed these five experts and is wasting their collective hour like five human hours are being wasted to respond to someone that he didn't even bother to look up on PubMed.That's what we're really dealing with here. Alex actually bothered to look on my LinkedIn.But Tom Cowan makes a show of saying that he didn't even bother.And it's a it's a hit piece. You can clearly see that this isn't meant to acknowledge what I just read to you.It's not meant to acknowledge that I just admitted that we there you could see that even if I wasn't.Even if in that text, I'm wrong about things, even if the quasi species is a complete illusion, even if it's only synthetic signals and that's it.PCR works DNA is something RNA is something and PCR can amplify it because we in control conditions that happens.And so maybe that's not that has not obviously that has not unlocked all the keys to understanding all of our biology.But that's the same thing as saying you don't understand how the grid works, but you understand how a light bulb works.There are lots of examples of light bulbs that we understand without understanding how the grid works.You can understand how a fan with an electric motor works right when you plug it into the wall, even though you don't understand how the grid is maintained.You can understand how you send an email, even if you don't know how packets of information move on the Internet or how multicasting works.And so it's very frustrating because again, you can only see this as part of the show.Remember that there is a picture of Andy Kaufman shaking hands with Andrew Cuomo at a grant award poster presentation in 2019, where his company or his group or whatever has been awarded a not tiny sum of money.I don't think it was millions of dollars to develop a prototype biosensor for prisoners.This is not just some guy who's been campaigning against the falsehoods of psychiatry for his whole life like Dr. Bregan has been an outspoken critic of things his whole life like Dr. Bregan has been.But now the psychiatrist that everybody knows is speaking out against psychiatry is Andy Kaufman and one of the first people to announce him as relevant for anything in my life happened in 2020 in March and in April.And the name came out of the same mouth five weeks in a row over and over again.We have to oppose the no virus people.We have to stop people like Andy Kaufman.We have to oppose the 5G people.And that was not a mistake, ladies and gentlemen, they are or some of these people or some of the people behind them are part of the narrative curation machine.Lableic, natural virus, no virus, three wrong answers, three sets of dumb questions and a spectacular commitment to those three lists of questions has gotten us where we are today.Where there basically three camps.The camp that thinks it's just the way it is the camp that thinks that we did it and the camp that thinks that there's none of this.Is not tuned in to the idea of of what we know and don't know about biology but actually being encouraged to discard everything we have learned in biology to discard all of the knowledge that we have rather than just the contaminated parts like virology and public health to re examine what we know.We don't want to do that we just want to burn the whole library down instead of getting the books that have been plagiarized out to get the books that are actually not supposed to be in the nonfiction section out of the nonfiction section.They were encouraging us essentially you heard Tom Cowan yesterday say that there are no ion channels no ion currents no no action potentials none of these these phenomenon are real.And so he's suggesting we should just burn down the entire nonfiction section instead of getting rid of this books that are full of lies the fiction part.And you're seeing it in real time right here I actually think Mark Bailey is an unwilling participant at this point.He hasn't smiled on camera in in ages.Because he doesn't feel comfortable. I don't think walking this exact line all the time where we're going to talk about isolation and purification and nothing else.And we're going to pretend that there's no other argument to be made.And more importantly we're going to pretend that nobody was murdered to make up this shit.Because that's the part that the no virus people never have said in three years is that if there was no virus then what happened.That means that people were murdered in the United States. Why aren't they saying that they either murdered them or they lied that they died in either way it's part of there's no virus isn't it isn't it.And yet for some reason in this hour you're not going to hear one peep about the people that have been been killed because our border was opened and opiates flooded our streets.You're not going to hear one mention of the fact that American authorities are lying about what happened in America to make sure that we believe there was a virus when there was no virus.No. They're just going to keep harping on foias.And they're going to keep harping on the experimental protocols that they say they're calling out that's fine.I get it.But they called those protocols out for AIDS too.So it's a song that's been sung you can you can cover it but then let's let's let's make new music here.Let's move on.But they won't.And I can't stress how important it is for everybody watching this to try and really grasp that.That if their goal was to score a touchdown on there is no virus, then talking about the murders in America and in Europe and in anywhere else where they occurred in order to create the illusion of spread would be a central part of their presentation every night.So let's do it.The virologists and people on other people have reasons why that can't why you can't find them like that.And so OK, so that's that's that.So then you go to the next step, which is the what they call the viral culture.And again to be very clear and I would say there's no disagreement about this with anybody that can anyone not see that can anyone not understand that.If you don't say there was no SARS-CoV-2 spreading and therefore they murdered people, then you're not you're not you're not doing it.They have had four years to say it.Four years they've been standing on the PCR is dumb and there's no virus, but they haven't been able to say therefore people were murdered.Therefore people lied about how many people died.They're not saying that they're not saying that wow they what how did these people get killed then.Is it because we treated them all poorly?Why don't they want to explain that so that people can see the full malevolence.And the reason why is because it is a slow role to the truth, ladies and gentlemen, it is a slow role to the truth.All the pigs are not in the cage so you cannot spring the trap yet.A lot of the pigs have been in the cage for a long time and are wondering what the hell we're doing out here yet.But ladies and gentlemen, see this for what it is.I just read to you what they are responding to.They're going to tell you that they're responding to a live stream that I did, but it's nonsense.This is a week after I sent that email and the emails that follow it are extraordinary.I mean I challenge them.I'm like you don't need me to give you a paper on infectious clones.Go to PubMed, insert those two words, hit search and just start reading and you will see infectious clones are the way it's done.And they just, you know, they say that that means that I ignored their request for papers that I couldn't provide any papers.That's what they'll say here.The virology community since 1954 has said that the way you find a virus, the way you isolate a virus, the way you identify and show that a virus exists is you put a sample on a cell culture and if there is a cytopathic effect.It's so much easier to say virology is a lie and they murdered people to hide that.The vaccine schedule is criminal and they murdered people to hide that.Isn't it so much easier to say that than this bullshit and once you see it, once you hear it, you realize what they've done.The CPE, that proves the existence of the virus.Everybody agrees that that is virology's central claim and that is the foundation of virology.And every other claim about antibodies, about sequences, about anything else to do with virology rests on that isolation, they say, because if you haven't isolated, i.e. have a pure sample of the virus, you obviously can't find the sequence.You can't show that the antibodies are against it and on and on and on.Now, we're saying I got some emails from Christine Massey that I've become convinced weren't even written by her because the language is just too much.There is no way that this lady that I've seen, I've watched a few podcasts of her just to try to figure out how is it that this lady can write emails like this.I just have become convinced that she hasn't written those emails that they're written by somebody else.That the so-called viral culture is not a scientifically valid procedure because there are no independent variables, i.e. the presence of a virus.And so they never do a sample that they say has the virus and then take the virus out and then see if they get the same cytopathic effect, which is the only way that that experiment would be valid.And so we say that the foundation of virology is not valid.It's not a scientific.Oh, they got my email because I wrote an email on behalf of CHD at that time. So I was genuinely thinking that that text was going to make a breakthrough, that we were actually going to come on and do a show.Maybe Bobby would even do a podcast where I would explain infectious clones to one of these people and we could agree about the fact that the molecular biology could have been seeded and misconstrued.And we could move on together and it just frickin exploded into this email attacking back and forth. You suck. Give us this you liar blah blah blah.It was unbelievable.I spent like three hours writing that thinking I got to say it right. I got to say it right. I got to give them enough compliments.I got to admit what we don't know.I got to say what CHD is letting me say. I got to use this one opportunity to actually bridge this gap and it frickin exploded. It was so sad.And this was the only result.Besides, I think Mary meeting Christine Massey on a CHD or sorry, a doctors for COVID ethics meeting on maybe two weeks or three weeks later where I was not told that meeting was happening and I didn't see it live and there's only clips left of it.Procedure. And so there you cannot use that procedure in the way they use it to claim the existence of a virus.I would think and I think everybody out there would think that the entire argument of the people who are arguing against us would be to say, but Tom and Andy and Mark and Christine and Alec, the viral culture is the gold standard.It is the foundation of virology. It is a 100% accurate.We are going to show you that this viral culture is a is a scientifically validated way to prove the existence of a virus.But you know how many times somebody like Dr Cooey or the others who is quote, try to debunk us or argue with it have ever gone over the papers and the procedures of a viral culture.Never.That's technically not true, but I know that he shouldn't. He shouldn't necessarily know that right. I mean, it's fine. Not everybody watches my streams. I get it.But that's not true. I have I actually explained it in big words over there in that email. I tried to imply that I understood it. And if he had looked at the streams that I was doing then he would have heard me say it.As I explain the infectious cycle is best we understood it and hinted at that that might not even be right. If it's exosomes, I was still working through it because we're all still working through it.And they are absolutely certain there's nothing to work through there's just nothing here. All of these signals, all of these observations are false, our lies or are something.And so, rather than being there an illusion of consensus about some aspect of these observations and a miss misappropriation of these observations to support something they don't support.These guys just want you to burn the whole library down.And that's a very dangerous position to take because we actually know quite a bit, and we could. It could be helpful in turning the ship around.This, this Dr Cooley, as far as I saw his comments, never mentioned the viral culture or tried to validate or explain to the world or to us that the methods that the viral culture use are a scientifically validated way to prove the existence of a virus.And yet, that's the whole argument. And, you know, I came up with an analogy.I would say that the whole argument is is that they lied, and they murdered people.The whole argument is not that virology as it stands right now is is crappy science.That's not, that's not going to solve the problem that that requires people to to rather than accept lying.They have to accept something about the world. They have to accept something about something they've already been told they can't possibly understand.So he's kind of putting everybody that listens to him in a weird position because you're supposed to accept his interpretation that all of it is nonsense, rather than all the other illusion of consensus around the world that says it's not all nonsense.And that's pretty extraordinary ask of anyone.And in fact, I've come to realize or come to believe that that ask is extraordinary because it is one that isn't necessary.It's one that doesn't save you. It's one that doesn't save your kids and it's one that doesn't save your grandkids.Because you're not left with a question there.You're not left with the question of what are these signals? What is respiratory illness? What is our immune system doing? What are antibodies then?You're not left with any of those questions. Instead, you're told not to ask any more questions about those things because they're all done.And so it's very important for me to emphasize that the goal of this is for you to understand why the no virus position has always been weirdly curated and weirdly weaponized in a way that has never looked to score a touchdown.But just to keep everybody scrambling in different directions, if they wanted to score a touchdown, all the pieces are there.They've even had the floor at CHD with other people on the other side of the camera and they haven't managed to score a touchdown.And the reason why is because one or more of these people or one or more of the people behind them advising them is making sure they don't score that touchdown because that's not the plan.And whoever is involved in the meddling is part of the plan. I assure you.Because the plan is for all the marbles. They left nothing to chance.And wherever there was something they didn't expect, they co-opted it or they got rid of it.With me, they tried many, many people to co-opt me. Many, many people tried to co-ordinately lie to me.And I bought it many, many times and four years later, we're finally here where I feel like, you know, more or less, I know who lied to me.And fortunately for my grandchildren, it's a lot of these people.It's a lot of the people who say that they're saving us, that they have the answer, that they're certain that they're right.Those are the people who were lying to me and they lied to my face. They lied to me on Zoom.They lied to me in SMS. They lied to me on Signal. And that experience is what keeps me coming back every day.And so I'm putting this up because I really need you to understand that I didn't ignore this video for any other reason than it didn't need amplifying at the time that people weren't ready to hear it at the time.Because I hadn't figured it all out at that time. I still didn't know who was all meddling with me.And I was still working for Bobby's book and so it just didn't seem like the right thing to do as far as publicity and.But this was there in 2023. They did this in 2023 in response to an email that I wrote that I had every hope in my being was going to be a breakthrough moment for this no virus group that they would finally be able to add a level of nuance to their messaging that would kick them up a level.And instead they rejected me like you cannot believe and here it is because I like to do that so that everybody will understand.It's like we're having an argument of our discussion or a debate of whether these three dots are in a straight line.And so people look at it and they say well it looks straight to me or my aunt Bessie said it was straight or we thought it was straight for 40 years or we vaporized the paper and we got a bunch of chemicals.And so that proves that this was straight or well you could draw a line from the ceiling and it goes through different ways and everybody would say why don't you just take a ruler and go like that and they're not in a straight line.Why do we have to argue about this just get a ruler and measure it and if it's straight with straight and if it isn't it isn't.And so if you want to say that the cell culture the viral culture is the way to prove the existence of a virus which everybody agrees on.Let's have the entire debate about the viral culture.Let's have the entire debate about the viral culture has been their strategy since the very beginning and I would argue that sticking to that strategy cannot be something that they they just have accidentally stuck to.And when they break free of that strategy finally this year if they do it will be because that was the plan all along.That was the plan all along.And I don't know which of these people were brought along which of these people are our unwitting participants but it's unfortunate because this this really set us very far back said a lot of people very far back because I can tell everybody out there.I don't know if I have any disagreement from any of our other panelists.The viral culture has is not a valid way to show the existence of a virus.The foundation of virology is simply incorrect and no matter how much you vaporize the paper it doesn't show whether it's a straight line.So all we're asking is let's talk about the science of a viral culture.If you do that you'll see it's not a valid they don't do it they don't do appropriate control.What what about in a world where viruses exist but everyone involved has both exaggerated their ability to identify and study viruses and underplay the danger of synthetic infectious clones.The most important thing is to move slowly you see.I'm trying to help them to understand that even if there are no significant RNA signals in the wild like coronaviruses they can make this RNA.They can make lots of it they can make the corresponding DNA and that alone would be enough to seed the molecular signal that they have misconstrued as a spreading pathogen.That is the crucial piece of the puzzle to understand that the entire illusion that Kevin McCurnan and Charles Rixie and these other people who are insistent that there was a novel virus that started spreading in October of 2019 in China and has spread all around the world including zoo animal population in whitetail deer in North America because of the fear and cleavage site.Because of the staff look cock and enterotoxin be homology is because of the HIV inserts because of the preanogenic sequences because of the amyloid a genetic sequences whatever story they told you from the very beginning.I lost my train of thought there because I'm just very frustrated I didn't I didn't remember this being so annoying.But I do remember being incredibly disappointed by their responses because I thought I really put it out on the line there and I really thought it was a significant moment that Bobby and Mary asked me to write this email.I thought it was a very significant moment and in retrospect I still think it might have been.I wonder what they would have done if these people would have come back and said oh wow let's have a discussion about this let's hear this rather than came back with their angry response and their snotty response and their shove it in your scientific advisors response.What if they just said could we have a zoom meeting and discuss this with him.Maybe a private zoom meeting with you and Mary and they didn't ask for anything like that they didn't suggest anything like that they didn't say thank you very much for your thoughtful email.It was nothing like that.It was immediately back to viral isolation.Da da da da da.I can look at it and tell you without showing you what it was I think.Dear Robert and Mary I'm following up one last time hoping you will provide answers Mary if you are expecting jacoie to answer the questions on behalf of you Robert and CHD please let me know.He offered to share a hypothesis with me but didn't address any of my questions.So that's really it right.Thanks for getting back to me this is great although I don't see any citations or answers to my questions and to be honest I now have a few more questions.Coronavirus is exist they want me to prove the same the stable quasi species idea and infectious clones found in laboratories all over the world if it's a synthetic virus was ever made was suggested why is it unfindable in the human body why is it impossible to purify it so again they tried very hard to go back to the purification and and and isolation.Even though in general terms I had already said and admitted that I think a lot of these things are wrong.And so it seems very strange to me that that this is the direction that it went.And it's just unfortunate because I've reached out to the Baileys in 2020.Then I had contact with Andy Kaufman in 2021 through the Piper Stover lady who helped me or co-authored or kind of helped me with that review that I put out.And then I haven't had contact with in a very long time now.And she apparently could call Andy Kaufman so all these people are connected somehow weird way and all of them have tried to hide it from me.And so it is really without without reservation now that I just throw it all out on the line there.I think almost all of these people are connected in some way through a common handler or a common coordinated table of handlers.And that's why their narrative is so tight.I mean look I can't even give a presentation without going off on a tangent every five minutes but these guys they're tight.They stick right on cue like right on list. It's impressive.Because they say you can't take the virus out of the sample so you can't do a mock infection because that's what it means.And yet they say they do.So when you hear him talking everything is downstream.Never does he address.Here's the reasons why a viral culture proves the existence of a virus.Period. You guys are wrong.And so there in that time I think basically he's right. I never said that and I probably wasn't quite prepared to say it the way that I can say it now.A viral culture is just a transfection.Most of virology is done by making this synthetic RNA or the synthetic DNA and then transfecting or transforming a cell culture.And then having that cell culture do whatever it does.And whatever it does there it's most likely some kind of vesicle release or exosomes or you can say that it's just making copies of the RNA or subgenomic copies and then spitting them out.I don't know what it is. I agree they haven't really analyzed that.But whatever it is that happens in that cell culture that supernaton can be taken and that supernaton can be put in other preparations that will cause semi predictable things to happen.And that's the extent to which we get it.We don't have any equivalent from nature.In other words we can't do that experiment with the sample from a bat.Because if you put the sample from a bat in 96 well preparation and only two of those wells show any signal like they did when they isolated the virus in Wuhan and then you use metagenomic sequencing to claim that something's in there.That's already pretty sketch.And since metagenomic sequencing is essentially proprietary technology that was invented by Nathan Wolfe and friends.It just feels very bad.Metabiota is nothing that we want in our narrative of reality.And so again they are right about all these things.They were right about these things from the beginning.And so again if they really wanted to score a touchdown I'm going to say it one more time and they would say there was no virus and they murdered people to lie about it.They were willing to murder people to make sure that this illusion of no virus was preserved and that we would pass this illusion on to our children.And they don't seem to be able to say that.They just want you to say over and over again Dr. Cooey won't debate the viral preparation.Dr. Cooey won't debate viral culture.It's an important thing to see.That never happens. That's why we never get anywhere with these debates.And there you go.So that's a little long winded but I thought we could put that in context and anybody else has anything comment on what I just said I'd love to hear.Well Tom I actually you know I agree that no one really ever wants to debate this but I actually got the sense from some others that they kind of concede that the viral culture really doesn't prove it.But they want to point to all this other indirect evidence and say that the totality of it adds up to the proof or you know or have the appeal to authority kind of fallacy where you know virologists have been discovering and studying viruses for you know 60 years and they couldn't have just wasted all their efforts.Oh, oh, so that's addressing another point they couldn't have just wasted all their efforts.Is that a nuanced way of saying it because he's about to say they're all wrong.The observations were real their interpretation was wrong.They couldn't have all been wrong in that book from the 80s.Those gels are real those preps are real those guys are trying to figure it out.At the time they didn't have any better tools this is what they saw.I think we're going to find that it is much more subtle than virology as a whole is is is fake.That there are no viruses is to say that there are no signals at this size scale and we know that there are.I've been biologists all around the world for three decades working on what's called exosomal communication and all of these researchers and research lines have been absorbed by a funding schemes into cancer biology and exosomal communication is exclusively studied under the rubric that it is a way of finding and diagnosing cancer rather than an aberrant signal produced by cancer which has its own.Natural homolog in exosomal communication that's there and pleasant in the plasma all the time.That the immune system might communicate with retro viruses and that the contamination of our plasma with other retro viruses from other animals might be devastating to our immune system is probably the story behind AIDS.Which doesn't say that there's no AIDS it doesn't say that there's no retro viruses it doesn't say that some people were not hurt because their immune system was compromised but how it is being compromised the mechanism by which it's being compromised and the possible solutions for it have been distorted by a mythology.And so I would suggest that respiratory disease as it stands in a big umbrella term has been distorted to be caused by.A signal which may only be roughly correlated with it sometimes, and that is exosomal signaling exosomal signaling where an RNA dependent RNA polymerase is present.Because the one theme of RNA virology is an RNA dependent RNA polymerase, which they would like you to believe is a virology exclusive enzyme but it's not.And I think that's probably one of the bigger lies they're protecting is if you understood that all virology that supposedly this Baltimore scheme describes all these special enzymes that only viruses have here just buying into their nonsense.They have taken that that endogenous biology that's most likely ours and misconstrued it as exclusively virology.It's not. It's exosomal communication and maybe there are rare examples where exosomal communication can go wrong and maybe one rare example is measles or maybe one rare example is a herpes virus.Maybe. I don't know. I'm not a virologist, but I can. I can say with a pretty reasonable amount of confidence that I'm willing to risk my family's future on the idea that RNA cannot pandemic.I'm willing to risk my family's future on the idea that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.And I'm willing to risk my family's future that somewhere in this group of people or somewhere behind it is a group of people that was using this argument and this set of questions to discapacitate the D.I don't remember what his word was, but to to remove our ability to exercise informed consent to set another cognitive trap where people would get stuck in a hamster wheel and that hamster wheel would feel like they were doing something right.Just like I was in a hamster wheel in 2020 and early 2021 thinking that a lab leak was part of the story I needed to tell in order for people to understand what was going on.And that arguing about a lab leak or and not a natural virus and pointing out that it was a cover up was part of waking people up.And that's a that was a hamster wheel that people tricked me into jumping into it and sprinting on.And I would suggest that this is another hamster wheel that a lot of people were encouraged to get on and run fast like her.And her campaign for fluoride is over now or or or what.Now it's just foia foia foia.I don't get it other than I feel like this was curated.And I'm I'm pretty sure I'm right.You know, but but it seems like sometimes that it's there is no real argument that you can be capable eyes.That's true show that the viral culture is a proper scientific experiment because as you pointed out there is no independent variable.So right there you can kind of toss it aside.You don't even have to say that there's no valid control because first you have to have the independent variable to begin with,which means you actually have to discover a virus in nature because that is the independent variable.You can't use an indirect experiment to prove something exists without having the thing in the first place.Unless the thing like an RNA dependent RNA polymerase already exists in the background as a as a rare signal that can be found because that's how coronavirus was found in the.Early 2000s.And again, I suggested that they go back to those literature and just read it because I agree with them wholeheartedly.They were looking for an enzyme and actually an only a small 300 base pair ampicon part of that enzyme most conserved.And then use that as the basis for saying, OK, we have a signal in this tube.And so now we're going to use Nathan Wolfe and metagenomics.Metobiotas, excuse me, metagenomics sequencing algorithms to pull up all the signals in this tube because we found this one ampicon of an RNA dependent RNA polymerase and that's an indicator of a coronavirus.That's exactly the wording in these papers from the WIV and from Barrick's lab that collaborated together that supposedly represents the foundation of gain of function coronavirus research.It's just indirect measurement of RNA ghosts.And I've been saying that for about three years now, two years really hard one year, hardened to paint.And they're ignoring that.And they continue to ignore it quite frankly, which is really extraordinary.So, you know, that's that's the whole point of it. And by arguing about, oh, you know, the cause of this illness or about a phenomenon that you see in the laboratory or about genetic sequences reported in a database.All that really is completely irrelevant when you haven't started with actually discovering the organism and nature first.Right.I just add to Tom with regards to virology and the agreed upon way in which they isolated quite virus.And we know that the cell culture is one of the things they've held up since the 1950s is perhaps their quite gold standard.But we should also be careful too because they incredibly loose within virology when they use the term isolation.And I truly believe we need to address this to my suggestion to you is is that if they wanted to have pushed this ball farther than they did in 2020, 2021 or 2022, they could have by explicitly saying that if there is no virus, the only conclusion we can come to is that if anybody is dying, they are dying for no reason.They are dying because they are being manslaughter murdered.And for three years, for whatever reason, this group of geniuses was never able to get past the isolation purification virology cultures are fake.But if they murdered people and lied on television in order to preserve this mythology, you'd think that would be a pretty powerful part of the story for them to regularly hammer.Hey America, we're too cute little New Zealanders down here in New Zealand having our own little farm and living all naturally and we just wanted to let you know that one of the reasons why we know they're lying about virology is because they probably just murdered people in America.But Sam Bailey's never been able to come to that conclusion, never been able to do that math where wait, if the PCR was fake, which she was talking about in 2020.Then they treat people differently. Remember these people are both doctors, both Baileys are MDs.He had somehow or another they never said that well if the PCR is fake, and then they start treating people for pneumonia differently like you know not using antibiotics or or not using or using something like Remdesivir and Medazolam.Where is all the summary over how obvious it is that there's no virus because they murdered people with Medazolam because they lied about the cause of death because they use respirators and ventilators when they shouldn't have because they use drugs that kill people because they flooded the streets with opiates because of this long list of things.There is no virus instead it is purification, isolation, culture, purification, isolation, culture, three dots on a page and arguing about whether they connect or not.And they did it for going on for years now.There's just something wrong with it.I think that's what's wrong with it. It's not meant to score a touchdown just like Robert Malone's objection to the vaccine on June 20, June and 2021 on Brett Weinstein's podcast with Steve Kirst wasn't meant to score a touchdown just like the vaccine safety research foundation isn't meant to score a touchdown.They're meant to be hamster wheels that delay our progress.That make us feel productive by asking the wrong questions over and over and over again.I haven't even standardized it so if you read a what most biology textbooks you cannot find it in the glossary. It will not specifically say what it is. And we all know from listening to biologists that it can mean anything from taking a sample from a person.It can mean the cell culture result. It can mean plaque essays.It can mean simply detecting genetic sequences.So all of these methodologies have been used to declare isolation.I really know argument with Mark Bailey. Most of the things that he says are so focused and spot on. I like the farewell to virology document. It's pretty solid as well.It complements and builds on things that people did before him.Mark Bailey may be the reason why all these other people exist.And maybe why a lot of people try to focus on Sam Bailey all the time instead of Mark.Mark is really not down with it the game that we're being that's being played here. Mark is not really down with it.He was not a impressive interview on Mark Hulack show for example.When Mark Hulack asked him about exosomes it was just kind of a big.It's unfortunate. You know they have as much certainty as the liars do about virology that they're right.But they have no nuanced explanation for where we are just nowhere.I think the reason this is important and we'll see in some of the comments.I'm not talking about Mark though. I'm talking mostly about Andy Kaufman and Tom Cullin.I swear about to analyze is that and I'll address this criticism of Christine's work before as well.In fact I dedicated a whole section to it in my essay a farewell to virology.And people will allege that Christine is wording it in some particular semantic trick so that there's no possible way that they could know what we're trying to argue is is that there are a number of reasons why foias don't work as definitive evidence of anything.Especially if you start foying random police departments.And then it doesn't matter what language you use or or or how you do it.This is another one of those hamster wheels and then to emphasize this hamster wheel as gold standard evidence.See we told you so.Anybody that works in government anybody that works in the press for any length of time anyone that's tried to get information from the government using a FOIA request especially the American government understands that even if you have all the nuances correct.They can still avoid you.They can still delay it.They can still give you a non answer.Never mind the fact that if this is as I've posited for several years now a national security priority.They can just lie.Come on.I said I'm quite a virus but Christine's work is super important because thousands of times around the world and it's not just starts cop to it's with all sorts of quote viruses.They say that I said I did.They actually say in the titles of these papers that they have isolated the virus and we know that they have and I think that that's what Dr.He says it very nicely and I really appreciate that that he he he respects that that you know he says it in a way or you're missing it and I think that what they're missing is is that the other half of the story is then that means they murdered people and you guys have missed it for four years where you.It would have been an easy slam dunk for you to say on every single appearance you were ever on Andy Kaufman doesn't care about the people that were murdered in his state of new home state of New York.Isn't that where he lives or is he live in Vermont.I mean it's crazy.The mass casualty event in New York City that could be used as the shining beacon of lie and deception and murder by these people for as long as the pandemic has existed as not on their radar at all.At all.Like just you know.Here's an easy dunk.No.Sorry I can't see that isolation.What'd you say again.I'm not sure what isolation is so Christine proved that you can go around the world hundreds of different institutions and when you find out what they actually mean by isolation we can see it doesn't have anything to do with the physical isolation of the particle and it can mean just about anything they want.And if you haven't isolated it you cannot study it and find out what it's made of that's just the rule of nature.I think it's a good question.I think it's a good question.I think it's a good question.I think it's a good

it,you make your best guess version of it.Now, why would you have to guess if something is real and in nature?Now, why would you have to guess if something is real and in nature?We've shown that we have the sequencing technologyto take a known organism and sequence it in its entirety.We've shown that we have the sequencing technology to take a known organismand sequence it in its entirety.We can talk about the significance of the genetic sequencein a separate discussion.Certainly there's no reason to guess.And then he goes on to say further that you use an infectious cloneproxy for it in order to study.Now, if the real thing exists,why would you have to use a proxy?Why couldn't you use the real thing?Nice! So here you go!You see how close we were in 2020,but they still want to pretend that this is an idiot?They are portraying to their listeners that I am as foolishas anybody has ever been foolish.Look at this, please.Oh, sorry, you can't see it.What do I have to do?Escape? Yeah.Look at this.Oh, this is in the player.I'm sorry. So I got to look it up on Rumble to show you this.Hold on one second, please.You're here for the long haul, so just hang on.I'll find it.Um...And I need to look for...It's like...No.Okay.No.No.No.Maybe that'll do it.Oh, what in the hell do I...Can I look at my history maybe?Darn it.Um...I just had it.I did. I swear I just had it.Darn it.Um...But what it says on the bottom of the Rumble...video version of this is...or one of them...it says that...that another...another something-something is...you know, destroyed by these people or...or you know, made a fool of whatever, corrected...it's a hit piece.Anyway, it's not meant to be nice.And they're not meant...they're overlooking what I just said, which is...they're overlooking what I just said, which is...they're overlooking what I just said, which is...they're overlooking what I just said, which is...they're overlooking what I just said, which is...really frustrating in retrospect how...how much they did not...thing. In fact, play fair.In infectious clone proxy requires significant...effort and technology.Whereas if you already have found this...organism or particle in nature...then you could simply study it further.You don't...Wow. So what is the point here then?Are they not going to admit then that an infectious clone...could be lied about?Because there are no viruses.Don't you see how I handed it to them?I handed it to them on a civil or platter.And then the guy who was shaking hands...with Andrew Cuomo in 2019 after winning a small grant...to produce a biosensor for prisoners...tells you to ignore the infectious clone comment.If an infectious clone is a proxy...then why do you need to use a proxy?He doesn't understand what I just said in my email...and what I've said there that it's a purity level...that doesn't exist in the future.And I'm not going to say that.I'm not going to say that.I'm not going to say that.I'm not going to say that.I'm not going to say that.I'm not going to say that.I'm not going to say

don't think I'm losing my voice.If I am, I just yelled too loud.I apologize for that.They assemble it on a computer.They don't actually sequence something.In some cases, the way they do the detection of the sequences,they didn't even do it in a reliable manner.Because sometimes it involves PCR with many cycles.To me, that tells you everything you need to know.No.Or just the fact that they never purify it tells you everything you need to know.So I would disagree that we need to besuper sophisticated and go into all sorts of extra details.Again, it's fine for people who are interested in it.We love that knowledge, but it's not necessary.That's it.No one else has an insert?Another edit?If we want to get into the thing about sequencing technology,it's just immaterial.Because whether it's Sanger sequencing,MicroPore, or Next Generation,they all give you a sequence of whatever genetic material that you start with.But that's not the problem.The problem is that, as Mark always points out,we don't have a sequence of what we're going to do.We don't have a sequence of what we're going to do.We don't have a sequence of what we're going to do.But as Mark always points out,we don't know the origin of any of those genetic fragments that we're sequencing.So whether we know the sequence or not,or what technology we use,doesn't tell us the answer to that question,is where those sequences come from.No one's arguing with this.No one's arguing. I was never arguing with it.They played clips where you can see it.You've watched shows for more than a year now where you can see it.I'm arguing with the idea that they havethey have bamboozled peopleinto thinking there's no waythat this could have been done.There's no way that it could be more sophisticatedthan just what, lying?Than they didn't murder anybody?I'm from.If we can't demonstrate that they come from a novel virus,then essentially we have to do some more work to interpretif they have any meaningful interpretation at all.I would add too, I think, like Tom suggested before,Dr Queen needs to specify which part we've got wrong.I'm not sure that he's aware of the body of workthat the entire no virus group have put together.It's absolutely pathetic.I'm sorry if I'm going to,I think that this is just nonsense.It's an act.It's a pretend act.Mark may not know because these people maykept him out of the loop or encouraged him not to watch.Or something maybe he's too busy.But if he'd have just done an objective look into who I was,Mark would have reached out to me, I think,and said, "Wow, dude, you're so close."Or, "Wow, interesting."But they don't want you to understandthat PCR could be faked.They don't want you to understand that a background signalcould be misconstrued as spread.They don't want you to understand all the different waysthat they could be lying simultaneously.What they want you to do is focus on one,so that you never use the word "murder."They want you to focus on one,so that you never use the word "lies."Have they ever said that they're lying about virology?Have they ever used the word "lier"?Not just in the last two or three years,but this is the state back to the 1990swith the Perth Group, etc.and has really built up momentum perhapsin this COVID-19 era.But, yeah, it's not a technological issue.Stephen Lanker's been really good at this too.He's just pointing out that since theinvention of the virus model,it's refuted itself on its own termsso many times that it's amazing that it's still alive.So, when you get better sequencing technologiesand then virology doesn't use them,isn't that kind of suspicious?Isn't that yet another aspect of your storythat I was handing to you on a silver platterthat you're just misconstruing as something that I got wrongor don't understand?That is just sad to me.It's pathetic.It's really disturbing to seehow insistent that they are,somehow convinced that whateverwords come out of my mouth, I don't get it.And even when I say it, she makes cutelike I said it, but I didn't get it.It's really impressive.So, the state's back to experimentswith the legis to back a mosaic virus.You can see that they never establishedthat anything was capable of passingbetween the plants in the late 1800s.So, it's really disturbing to seehow consistent they are,passing between the plants in the late 1800s,right through torecently with the technology they're using today.But the issue is,like we say, it's notwhether you can detect proteinsand detect genetic sequences, that's all fine.The issue is what it actually means,what's the relevance,and showing that it relates to...So, I'm saying that they can detect sequencesjust like Mark Bailey, and I'm suggestingthat they have more than enough technologyto put those sequences where they intendedto find them.And then, aspectacular commitmentto lying about thatwould be a real good wayto start a pandemic, but you'd still need to kill people.People still need to die,and more than normal.And so, why do they spendso little time talking aboutthat crucial aspect of this illusion?You can't just lie to peopleabout viruses if people also don't die.And yet,somehow or another, in three years,they've never been able to justmuster up the courage to say, "This is how they did it."It's not just fakingmethodologies, they also have to fake results.Fake the results of lockdown,fake the fidelity of lockdown,the signal was missing in Australia untiltheir borders opened again,is all part of the orchestra.And so,it's not just faking methodologies,they also have to fake results.The borders opened again is all part of the orchestration.And there's lots of waysthey could have done that.But they could not have faked dying people.I think they needed to do some prettyamazing magic tricks to fake dying people.And so that's why they probably didn'tall fake dying people.There were probably a lot of people that weremurdered in New York City and around the world.Murdered by ignorance,murdered by unwilling participantsthatfollowed protocols because they were told.And so, we don't need to discussany of the other aspectsof the crime.We just need to discuss the oneaspect of the crime that is drunk driving doesn't exist.There's no way, nope,that doesn't exist.There's no other way that this could have beenperpetrated on us.There's no other way that this could have been done.It's just simply they're all wrong.All the way back to the 1800s,whatever they were looking at is wrong.Okay? So, what's the explanation then?And that's what we're doing.And I think we're nailing it.And that's why they had to ignore us because it's not time for the truth to come out yet.Maybe the time to come out will be whenRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is in his second termand my book's out and then he hires meas some kind of advisor andAmerica's already divided into 50 separate statesand our constitution has been dissolved.Maybe it's only after my family and I are forced to move to the Netherlandsand then when I'm over there,somehow somebody finally acknowledgesthat, oh, it's probably just infectious clones.And then they lied about it.Probably just a background signal that they characterized before the pandemicand then released all the informationfrom DITRO databasesand said that they were sequencing stuff.And then once the phylogeny was present,then they can let everybody sequence the backgroundand just drop it in who cares.These alleged viruses.I think the biggestproblems for virology is thatit's not even consistent on its own termsand we've demonstrated this over and over againis that they can't demonstrate validitybecause they don't use the scientific method.And as Andy pointed out before,you need to do control experimentswhere you have independent variablesand it's not just one thing like cell cultureswhere they're not doing controlled experiments.It's in everything.And I mean some of the stuff that Christineand her colleagues have gotdirectly from these researchers is just incredible.Where they basically admit that they don't knowcontrol experiments.And some of them sort of on reflection saythere's been a couple of really interesting oneswhere they've said, "Well maybe we should have, yeah, good point."So, yeah, I mean the entire thing,I'm not, I think againsomeone like Dr Coorey has to specifyexactly which bit we've got wrong.- Look at the smile on Andy Kaufman's face.What is that smile being generated by?What did he read or what is he seeing here?Because in my mind, Mark Bailey right nowis in good shape.In my mind, Mark Bailey right now is engagingin something like a lie.Because they played the clips.Multiple clips where I saidthat maybe it's an endogenous signal,maybe it's an immune signal, maybe they don't knowwhat they're talking about, maybe it's justmisinterpreted data. I don't even think they can isolate viruses.I said it all.And instead of saying, "Wow, he seems to agree with uson most of this stuff," they make it seemto their, they represent it to their viewersas though I don't get it.The caption of this video said that I didn't get itand that these guys have cleaned another clock.I hope I'm not belaboring the pointthat we have been bamboozledby liars. And I don't know where they arein this picture or if they're behind it.But I assure you that thisinsistence, that the only thing we need to talk aboutis this one little hamster wheel we've been onfor this entire hourwithout acknowledgingthe actual words in the clipsthat they played of me. It's extraordinary.Instead of alleging that we don't have any materialor that we're relying completely onFOIA documentation, etc.Because that's not where things are.The worst thing...My argument was is that this person right here,Christine Massey seems to go aroundflouting the FOIAsas enough.And that it frustrates me that somebody likeshe was being interviewed with, that wasa...a little bit more of a little bit more of a"that was a...that's the guy who does global..."His last name is likeMichael Chafkowski or something like that.He's a dude who's got like a globalnews website of some kind or another.And so she was being interviewed by him.And for an hour they're talking aboutthe significance of FOIAs. Never talkingabout murder and lying about protocolsand all this other stuff.But just hyper focused on this.The same thing that they've been focused on for this hour.And so that's what I was doing in that streamwas trying to say that they're missing this opportunityto take a step over the goal linewhere they would be able to make an argumentthat's a lot stronger, that even morevirologists would be potentiallypersuaded by. More academic biologistswould be potentially persuaded by.To demonstrate they understandthe nuances of PCR. They understandthe nuances of sequencing reactionsand that that's what they're doing.And so that's what I was doing in that stream.I was trying to say that they're missing this opportunityof sequencing reactions and that that signalcould be seeded.And explain to some of these peoplewho again they admit, the FOIAs seem to revealthey don't understand their own experiments.So then why not approach them about itand open that opening and say heyhave you ever thought about the possibilitythat infectious clones don't do what you thought they did?Have you ever thought about the possibilitythat what you're detecting doesn't seem toreplicate like you pretended it does?And then maybe some of these methodologiesshould be understood in a different way.Nope.I see and we see this withsome of the prominent so-called healthfreedom people is that they tryand trick the audience into saying that we don't have any materialor that there's nothing to what we're saying.Now, I mean I wrote an essay that was almost 30,000 wordsspecifically addressing all of theseproblems with virology but of all thesecritics that we've had, the ones I've been in contact withand I've asked them did you read my paper?Not one of them has. They don't even knowwhat they're doing.I've asked them if they've done anythingthat they don't have.They don't even pretend that they've read itand they basically say that they don't need toand then go back to citing all of thevirological nonsense that we'veclearly that's not me, right?But they're trying to put me in that same bucket.They want very much their viewers to not takeJonathan Cooey seriously as an alternative view.They don't want to take Jonathan Cooey seriouslyas a nuanced understandingthat is worth considering.They are putting me in the bucketof every other personlike Kevin McCairn, Charles Rixie,Kevin McCurn and everybody else.Merrill Nass that says there was a novelvirus that they treated multiple times,that early treatment worked for,that millions of people died from that probablywas leaked from a laboratory and maybeaccording to very recently maybe it waseven a clone and it spread around becausewe put a fear in cleavage site in it.I'm not sayingany of that anymore and yet they are doingthis entire hour to make sure that all ofthese things are being done and that weare doing this entire hour to make sure that all of theirviewers believe that I have,believe that that's meand misconstruing the argumentsthat they've even played as though they representa guy who thinks like that.He's a bunt.Okay, so now we'll move on to the final clip.This is the best one I've seen.You're just a comment on the no virus thing.Some listeners right now are going to get angry with mebut it's fine, I get cooped on from all directionsbut I just, and I found that no virus peopleare the most zealous, zealous almostcult-like because you don't get it from the peoplewho say oh it's a bioweapon or all the different scenariosbut the thing that gets me, I can believe thatI mean COVID was not a virus and it was allmanufactured, okay I can go with that butthey have further gone and they throw the baby outwith the bathwater sort of as you say and they sayinfectious disease never existed,pestilence, plague, contagion doesn't existwhen I know from my very well experiencedinfectious disease exists and that's the thingwhere it gets me whereit's not a virus that's going to bethat exists and that's the thing where it gets me whereguys I mean you've gone too faryou know, any thought on that?Yeah, I think you summarise it perfectlyI think it's, it is a,I've been trying to say this on my streamit is a bit of a trap and for some reasonI don't know if they'repart of this or not, I don't know how to really think about itbut some of the level of disingenuousnessthat exists on that side in particularis extraordinary becauseas I tried to say earlier although I guess I probably didn't say itvery well but they're very meticulouswhen it comes to looking at viral papersand pointing out the incongruancies between the control groupand the experimental groupbut more than a few of these peoplehave pointed to a woman by the name ofVeda Austin who takeswater from people's bottlesand freezes it and then it gives them messagesin the form of an image that she canyou know show you pictures of and say that water has all this emotional memorythese same people who want you to taketheir screen and say that water has all this emotional memoryand they say that water has all this emotional memoryand these same people who want you to take their scrutiny of virology seriouslyseem to not apply any scrutinyto some of the other people that they co-promotewhich is so bizarre to meand so obviously fabricatedI don't even know how to say it any other waybut if you can dedicate a whole hourto giving a meticulous presentation about how coronavirus 2 is never isolatedand that they're missing the proper controlsbut then pivot almost in a slideto water memoryand then not mention thatLuke Montagnier was working on water memoryin a very specific form with reference to DNA dilutionsbut focus exclusively on thisyou know pictures and images of emotionsit seems so so patently obvious thatthere's a game happening herethere wasn't any presentation of any scientific evidence to support germ theorythat was mostly just an adHoly shit!so they're not going to address the fact that Tom Cohen and Andy Cowan have promoted this New Zealand lady who can freeze water and see wedding rings in it when you think of wedding or lovethey're just going to completely ignore the fact that I have specifically said that the problem is that they're rightthat's what I was saying there they're right about virologybut then they're wrong about all this other shitso they cut that clip as best their clever ass could cut itand it still reveals their little game because in the endcontroller Andy Kaufman decides to completely ignore the clip they just playedthat is fricking amazing watch it again because that's really amazingisolated and that they're missing the proper controlsbut then pivot almost in a slide to water memoryand then not mention that Luke Montagnier was working on water memory in a very specific form with reference to DNA dilutionsbut focus exclusively on this pictures and images of emotionsit seems so so patently obvious that there's a game happening herethere wasn't any presentation of any scientific evidence to support germ theorythat was mostly just an ad hominem kind of attackand you know the the only thing really that contributes to germ theorywho said germ theory and I had hominem attackthis is just extraordinary to meI never watched this video to the end because I didn't have enough time in my life to wasteand now I do because I do think it's an important point to make because next month I might be on the same stage as this guythere's a good chance I think that after this show that could be a problem we'll seebut I noticed that at the red pill conference that Andy Kaufman's not talking about this biology at alleven though for all of 2020 that was his job that was what he talked aboutand before 2020 he was he was working on prison bio surveillancethis discussion is okay well if if you know pestilence in the plague really existsand just point us to the evidence that shows the you know agents that of causationand how that was determined and we would be happy to you know discuss itwhatever we think about anything else is you know just not relevant to the issueand you know water science which you know I think we've we've all talked aboutMontagnier's or at least Tom and I have talked about Montagnier's experiments and others who have done work in that areaand many other areasTom has also talked about the chick that I mentioned who freezes water and can read the emotions in itso don't obfuscate that that's what I saidit's related to water science so it's not a fair representation but it's still completely irrelevantyou know to the discussion about if germs cause diseaseit's not irrelevant because if they have a valid position about whether germs cause disease or notbut then they regularly undermine themselves by saying stupid shit like there's no ion channelsthere are no action potentials there's no electrical chemical conductance gradients acrosslipid nanolipid bilayers like Tom Cowan said on March 1 of this yearand so even though in that video you we watched yesterday he nails the ivermectin explanationand how they trick people into believing there was a novel virus by getting them to argue about whether ivermectin workedhe then pivots to saying that there's nothing going on in the brain that we understandand that none of this these biochemical and bio physical measurements that have done over the course of 40 yearsjust like the observations of these traveling RNAs is just all nonsenseall these observations should just be ignored and there's we know nothing about ion channels says Tom Cowanthey want you to burn the whole library because virology is a liethey want you to burn all of the sacred biology that that that we may have started tounderstand is there they want you to burn all of thatand they want you to go back to mythologies and and and witchcraft and and all this other nonsensehas the word nutrition been used at all in thishave they pointed out that Americans are extremely unhealthy so it would be a real easy way to pull off a mass casualty event or two to elevate all cause more to the other side of the worldto elevate all cause mortality with a combination of clever numbers and also really bad protocols in order to convince the world that this that this illusion of virology is truewhy not have a preface in the farewell to virology document that says this the illusion in this book is so important for them to maintain that wepause it that they probably lied about murdering people all around the world in order to make sure that this illusion of RNA high fidelity virology would be something that we would pass on to our children how long have I been saying that and how long have they been ignoring itbecause this video was meant to make sure that all of their viewers ignored mejust like Kevin McCairn makes videos to make sure that all of his viewers ignore me because the illusion was created by these people the illusion is being sustained by some of these people and the illusion is designed to trap us all and we're not all in the cage yetthat's why we couldn't have got here in 2020 that's why so many people were focused on making sure I didn't get here in 2020 even though I was damn closethat's the reason why people made sure that chd and these people didn't come together and one understanding in 2023 because we're not supposed to get there yet but we will I assure you we willbecause the truth cannot be hidden forever because the criminal vaccine schedule in America cannot be hidden forever because the lies that these people have told will not be hidden forever ladies and gentlemen they definitely will not be hidden forever[music]ladies and gentlemen this has been GigaOwn
