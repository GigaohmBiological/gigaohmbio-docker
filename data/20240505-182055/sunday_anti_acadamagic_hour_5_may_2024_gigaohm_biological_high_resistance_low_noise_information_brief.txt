Hello, welcome to Gigo on Biological, a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist. My name is Jonathan Kuhi. I'm coming to you livefrom my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is 1043 Eastern daylight time and it's another show. We're trying to do it at 1010 when your watch looks the best. But for some reason or another, the shenanigans of a family of five always get in the way during the weekend and I get on just a little late duringthe week. I think I'm going to be able to nail 1010 going forward because it feels really good to be here at 1010. I get out of the bed really fast. There's not a long delay between when I'm when I'm ready to go and when I'm going to go one o'clock always felt like I was ready to go by 10 and I wasn't going and so then I had to figure out how to work on the next day stream while still beready to go with this one. And so 1010 is working great today again like I said you know waffles and things get in the way. But I'm ready to go intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic. If you need to understand any of this biology because you're curious or because you think, wow, how can he string those words together and make any sense.You should tune into other streams that I've done you can find that on Twitch. You can find it on my own peer tube website you can find it some of them on rumble. Some of them have been on YouTube and I'm basically speaking to YouTube right now because I'm rarely here.And it seems like we at least have some viewers on YouTube which is kind of nice.The hypothesis running on this broadcast that has been formulated and fine tuned over the last couple years is that the who declared a pandemic of a particularly dangerous novel virus but it's likely that the tests were neither specific for a particular virus nor were they accurate at picking up something in the background but instead, either a combination ofnoise and pre existing signal was misconstrued as spread and because of the nature of the media campaign and the spectacular commitment to a universal almost universal set of lies.They were able to convince the healthcare conglomerates of, you know, everybody runs hospitals and doctors and TV programs and schools and nursing homes, all that something very significant one was happening when in fact it wasn't and you could consider it more like a fire drill where everybody's committed to the to executing the fire drill even when they find out that they didn't need to call the fire department or evenworse that maybe somebody on the inside wanted to run a drill and so then pulled the fire alarm, fully knowing that the people at the school were going to act like they was a fire and that the fire department was going to respond like there was a fire.And so if in the end the entire school got soaked in foam and some of the kids were killed because of the way that the fire department rushed in to try and save them.Then that would be part of the drill and they would learn from it.And if you think of the pandemic more like that, more like something that has been gained out over several other exercises, both tabletop and real, and as being sort of the fruits of this operation are being reaped by many different maybe even competing interests and competingweaponized piles of money all under the agreement that we're going to agree to lie or look the other way about what we all know wink wink is a national security operation and therefore lying about stuff is okay.And the worst part about it is is that I think that they put people out there already in 2020 with very specific parts of a truth narrative and told them to stick to it, so that none of us would be able to accurately assemble what was really going on because of this coordinatedsymphony of liars. And it wasn't just Tony Fauci and Rand Paul arguing about lab leak it wasn't just, you know, Peter Desack and Ralph Barrick.It isn't just the NIH it isn't just the DoD it isn't just one entity.First and foremost, we should think about who moves things in our world and that is weaponized piles of money and the men and women that control those weaponized piles of money.And then after that it might be the corporations that those weaponized piles of money can influence and move around and then maybe it might be the governments that can do the same things.Then you might think of the large investment banks as having something to do with it because they are intertwined with these, these private equity firm slash weaponized piles of money.But governments that can print their own money at Infinitum are also kind of weaponized piles of money aren't they now.Banks that can engage in fractional reserve banking is is definitely a form of weaponized money.And so these are the interests that they don't want us to think about instead they wanted us to solve a Scooby Doo mystery about a lab leak, which got us all to assume the presuppositions of the narrative which is that there was a lab leak that RNA can pandemic and and gigabiological has been teaching consistently for more than two years that it's likely that RNA no matter what specials Brewer and cleavage site or what special homology with with staff or staff or cock and enterotoxin B or whatever homologies with HIV, G P 120 have been inserted into a hypothetical gain of function spike protein that would not endow an RNA encoding it to encircle the globe and infect all zoo populationsin all the wildlife in America.No way.That's just a mythology.And if we go pre 2020 there's actually no academic Academy magic papers demonstrating that that's even remotely a possibility there are papers that use the word pandemic that use the words pandemic and potential in combination repeatedly even use it in the title.None of those papers represent a set of observations which edifies the idea that a pandemic of an RNA in a mud puddle can occur.At all.And so it is very likely after many many years of trying to convince us that this biological threat exists both in bad caves and in laboratories and soon in even the garages of of endeavors biological.Amateurs that we need to surrender all of our sovereignty over to these people so that we can get to the transhuman perfection that people like Ray Kurzweiler has told us are going to come in between 10 and 15 years where there will be no disease where there will be no death where we will live forever if we want to or some people will.And this mythology that's coming in the future is really just one contiguous intellectual mythology that extends all the way back to the special cancer virus program.And goes through the AIDS crisis and goes through the the chronic fatigue syndrome circuses that repeated more than once we found out very recently not just Judy Mickavers but one person before that thanks to Mark Hussetonic Mark it s.Mark Hussetonic live who's already had one YouTube channel canceled but when you go on YouTube to look for somebody like Robert Malone.There are hundreds of videos.But he's supposedly censored.If you go look for videos of Brett Weinstein who who apparently is just terrible.They're everywhere.But if Mark Hussetonic with Mark Kulak with with a few thousand subscribers does a video about Hillary Koprowski gets a strike.Strange world we live in ladies and gentlemen unless you see that it's just a gigantic national security operation that hasn't ended.It's ongoing.And everything that lives on YouTube is an admission because what couldn't live on YouTube and what does live on YouTube is very important.And it is not that the censorship is changing it is that the story is progressing.I think the best way to say it is that they need all the pigs in the cage and so they keep needing to put more of the truth out there so that more of us will go yeah see there we go.I knew it that guy's got it.And then they can close the cage.And they're not there yet I think the only way they're going to get the rest of us in the cages with pain and that's why I think we need to be very vigilant.And we need to keep working hard to wake up as many young people as possible because that's the rift I think they're counting on is that the young people will be on board the young people will be on board and the young people will be even angrier with us this time around whatever it is doesn't have to be disease X.It can also be election fraud X or assassination X or any number of grid down scenarios that then result in some kind of you know drama that then has a limited spectrum of debate that everybody's focused on and now we're now we've run out another year of the clock.And then the food supply next year and the inflation next year is double what it is this year and so even more people are suffering.And even more people are losing their houses to big banks and now we're into 2027.And maybe at that point we'll be talking about how actually we should have called this transaction all along and that there are a lot more people injured than we we realize and boy the American government is one shitty place.And then we're almost to 2028 and the controlled demolition of America and by by proxy all of the whatever's left of the republics of the West will be destroyed by by essentially the old the people that live there because the people that live there all around the world are being confused by fear andand contradictory narratives.I'm very very.I'm very very optimistic that our children are going to be able to pull out of this nose dive but I'm not very optimistic that the current crop of adults that we have now is going to be able to do it I'm up.I think we should try.But even if we get them I don't think we're going to get where we need to go that's why I think we need to focus on people that are younger than us we need to focus on young people and getting more young people to be able to express this message to me express the message that we have beenlied to by a symphony of coordinated liars who have accepted the role of perpetuating the the potential for a worst case scenario so that compliance would be maximum.And so that that absurd video of of Bill Gates that's going around right now where he says we're pretty much going to try MRNA on every vaccine that's already in existence and all the things that we've ever wanted to make a vaccine from, we're just going to try it with ourRNA to at least that's what we're going to invest in, because it's so cheap to make.And it's in a way, it makes perfect sense because these narratives in order to create the chaos is necessary have to continue to move farther apart.They have to keep doubling down on yeah it was natural and of course it's going to come again and of course vaccines are the best thing ever.And so we'll have to keep doubling down on the fact that no no it was a lab leak it was worse it could be even worse next time next time it could be a billion people, but also they're lying about these shots so we got to be very careful maybe it's just, I'vegot to double down in order to keep the fracture progressing deeper.As we've seen some other disarming satellite stories yesterday in the day before I think we're two extremely exceptional study halls that really brought home what I have been trying to bring home for a long time.I want people to complain.So what do I do.I go to Des Moines.Ladies and gentlemen and people on the screen I have nothing against Des Moines I live there for four years.I go to Des Moines.I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.I go to Seattle.I infect a couple of cases there.I go to North Carolina.I go to Wisconsin.What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition.These individuals complain again this is essential.Now the reason why this is important of course is because Dr.G.Ordon is explaining how the illusion of a pandemic could be created using a toxin.The whole context of this is that he's not going to release an agent that is contagious.It's not an agent that's contagious.It doesn't spread and in fact he doesn't want that.What he wants is people to complain.He wants a couple people in all these places to complain.And then the real what the weapon he's going to use is the Internet.He's going to tell people that there's asymptomatic spread.He characterizes is that it's something else in this video like.Like what does he call it.It's something about syndrome.I'll go back and banging on the door.The CDC comes back and says nonsense.That's not.So I don't know if I can do it.Let me see.Is it going to let me go back?Real.I come back and say that's fake news.Maybe it'll let me do it.I'm just going to run it again because I want to hear the whole thing.I want people to complain.So what do I do?I go to Des Moines.Ladies and gentlemen and people on the screen.I have nothing against Des Moines.I live there for four years.Oh, you, you, you.Sorry guys.I am.What I want is high mobility.I want people to complain.So what do I do?I go to Des Moines.Ladies and gentlemen and people on the screen.I have nothing against Des Moines.I live there for four years.I go to Des Moines.I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.I go to Seattle.I infect a couple of cases there.I go to North Carolina.I go to Wisconsin.What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition.These individuals complain.Again, this is a central nervous system condition.So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do.It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet.I take attribution for that.Yes, I'm a terrorist group.And now one of the things you have to remember is that it's a little more impressive during the pandemic.This is from 2017.The pandemic that we experienced, the real bug they used was the internet was also to have all the information that they used.They had all kinds of people already engaged in speculation about what the worst case scenario was.And they got people to engage in speculation about the worst case scenario by seeding a narrative of a lab leak and the potential for a cover up.And once you seed that narrative with people who agree with each other that wow, I mean, if this is a lab leak, then it could be much worse.And the numbers like are not of 16 would be totally feasible.I mean, if they engineered it, who knows.And there were people talking like that.And not just in in they had those people talking like that because as I've stated in previous streams.A lot of the people on this screen had no business knowing what they knew when they knew it or saying what they said when they said it unless they were queued up to do so.To make sure that not only were these ideas present very early and associated with the virus, but they could be sustained by these people as being first on the scene with this idea.And particularly I'm talking about the fear and cleavage site.Because the list of people and when they talked about the fear and cleavage site is so suspect at this point because not one of them.Not one of them in my humble opinion is turned out to be a legitimate.A legitimate dissident and trying to fight against the illusion of a pandemic but rather after four years has painted a very consistent picture of behavior which suggests that all along their job was to create and maintain thestory of potentially a worst case scenario that includes a disease that might resemble flying aids.And the people that propose that this might be the case early on in 2020, some of them are still saying it's going to come.And it's a very parallel story to what here at Vanden Bosch is talking about right now, which is a story that he started telling in January of 2020.January of 2021.And for a while I thought that he was the only one who was telling the truth and it was the thing that I pushed in my review was that we could potentially cause a disaster if there's any antibody dependent enhancement or if we influence the evolution of the virus that at that time I still thought was circulating.That I had become convinced again by a lot of meddlers that my idea in 2020 in May and June and July that they were lying about a background was ridiculous.And it was a lot of people that convinced me of that a lot of people worked very hard to convince me that that stance was ridiculous which is now my stance again.Because I've been able to over a consistent period of time, identify extremely inconsistent behavior and a lot of the people on this screen, not sukratt bhakti, not Nick Hudson, not Mike Eden, not Wolfgang Wodach, not really even Denny Rancor, not even really Peter McCullough.Peter McCullough does stay consistent on early treatment and on virus and on COVID-19 so yes that's why he's over here.Zeb Zelenko is gone.Bobby Kennedy spoke out in October about the lockdowns being wrong and about public health being a disaster and about them wanting to give us digital IDs and stuff like that and he wasn't wrong about that.But he also has sold the book saying that this is a gain of function virus that was a leak and then covered up and that Fauci and all these people are the Scooby Doo mystery salt.We have over here Pierre Corey who has sold the book about Iver Mekton.We have right next to him Brett Weinstein who came out in June of 2021 to say that he had the secret sauce of Iver Mekton that allowed him to prophylactically avoid COVID and that if everybody took it for 30 days him and Steve Kirsch agreed that we could all reach zero COVID as in the virus would be gone.This is Kevin McCarron in Japan who said in 2020 that a billion people could die and it might be the worst case scenario so we should make masks and a longer lockdown was already on the spike protein as a gain of function research as evidence of gain of function research and was very early on talking about how amyloidosis and pre-onogenesis might be engineered into this protein even though he's never spent any time at all.Teaching people what that means in the context of biology.What is a pre-on and what does it do and how would they take that and put it into a fusion protein of a virus.Nothing at all.How does amyloidosis work on a systemic level and how would they engineer that into the protein nothing at all.Just vague details about some modeling that they did or some algorithm that they use to identify these sequences or some in vitro experiment that they did in a dish which caused some kind of change or some kind of aggregate protein to form.Coming up with magnificent tales that try to tell a story about some particular aspects of transfection being criminally negligent into a special aspect of a special protein that was made by specially bad people.Instead of them just lying about transfection being a good alternative to the other crap that they used to inject into our children.They want you to believe that they put a special protein in you and that's why it didn't work or that the protein wasn't pure or that the RNA wasn't pure or that maybe it was the double strand DNA in there that's causing all this trouble instead of just the fact that transfection in its purest form would have been bad and remain so.Unless you have cancer maybe then it helps.And the crazy part about Robert Malone for example who a lot of people still think he's a hero.Is that you know what's really weird that's no one's pointed out until right now because no one's trying to figure this out really.Is that what is actually strange is that he tells the story over and over again I just heard it again while I was shooting around with Jay Bhattacharya on the illusion of consensus podcast isn't that weird.Robert Malone regales him with the story that he threw away his career once already and by throwing away his career he means that he got three articles in the New York Times where he was interviewed about his expertise in transformation that is using adenovirus carrying a gene to treat a genetic disorder and after those articles he claims that he lost his career but what happened was he was given a breast cancer institute somewhere else which is not exactly losing your career.And the funny thing about that story is is that again remember I remind you Jessica Gelsinger Jessica Jesse Gelsinger died of an adenovirus basically that was injected to into him to give his liver a protein that it didn't have in the theimmunological consequences of that were liver failure because his immune system attacked his liver acutely because you can't express a protein that's not your own in the liver and expect the immune system to ignore it.The lipid nanoparticle did exactly what it was supposed to do it went right to the liver because that's where it goes after its hit floats around wherever the hell it wants to a lot of them go to the liver maybe up to 70%.And so in reality that's where probably a lot of spike protein is expressed in a lot of people as well.And so liver damage is also something that's very possible, I think.But with regard to this they had especially.I mean it killed him acutely.And so Robert Malone claims this guy over here one of these these people claims that one of the, you know, sort of evidence of his 20 career 20 year career of being a golden lion of bioethics.Is that he was the one who blew the whistle on Jesse gelsinger you could also see it as he's the one who controlled the limited spectrum of debate about how people would talk about this.And it turns out that one of the stories that's really central is that they went off protocol and gave him a higher dose because they believed so much in the therapy.And so the argument is kind of weird because he's not saying that the the identifiers didn't work he's saying that the scientists were unethical because he's saying that the scientists were unethical because he's saying that thescientists were unethical because they went off the protocol and gave him more and a higher dose than they had had planned or had written down.And he makes a big story about how he had to consult with his bioethics friend to decide whether he had the obligation to come forward and then he did and then he even makes fun of the ethics guy because apparently thatethics guy started an ethics institute with Jesse's dad and that makes him have conflicts of interest but unlike Robert Malone he just chose the high road.Well after that long story is it really weird then that when the first vaccine that came out in the UK was an identivirus based vaccine encoding a spike protein that he didn't speak out immediately because he said well I did this 10 years ago already aidentivirus doesn't work like that. Holy shit are you going to give people a identivirus that expresses a spike protein. I already lost my career once speaking out against this idea you can't do that in healthy humans.He didn't at all.He was silent.In fact you can find videos of him talking in 2021 about the highly vaccinated population in the UK being a possible source of.Oh isn't that an interesting oversight.Maybe he should have spoke out against the AAV before the mRNA was even hitting the market he should have already said whoa wait a minute.I was in the New York Times three times a decade ago talking about how bad this is you can't possibly think this is the right way to go are you are you crazy.You

There was never a language problem.It's just throwing a lot of computing power at somethingand getting right most of the time is not impressive.Language was always a trick.Or at least capable of being used that way.And all of these people are aware of it.And so this illusion is part of the greater illusionthat AI can solve some giant problems that have to do withwhat I would call the irreducible complexity of our sacred biology.You know, the reason why all of us have to admit that we have a creator,we have something divine in us,and there is something divine all around usthat is never going to be distilled down to a combination of machines.It's never going to be distilled down to a combination of instructions.It's always going to be irreducibly complex,and it's always going to result in a reverence for what we don't know.And these people are in the business of undermining that reverencefor ourselves and for our world, for the food that we eat,for the beauty that our children represent.That's what transhumanism is about.That's what all of these ideas are about.And that's why all of these people push them.And if they don't push them, they oppose them in an ineffective and limited sort of way.And that's what this is about.This he probably doesn't understand the significance of what he's being toldand doesn't understand the significance of what he's talking aboutbecause he does think that this is just the tip of the iceberg of what AI can do,fully aware of the fact that he just got told that you still need a skilled technician.And the skilled technician's got to spend thousands and thousands of hours,and the skilled technician will still be necessary to verify it.And then in the end, we haven't really solved any problem other than made it easier for usto not teach anybody the skill, but instead sell them the skill.Think about how malevolently capitalist and futurist it is for him to give this talk.And at the same time started out with, "I've got a new book about God."It's awful.And that's why I think it's an important Sunday program to see that there areAkadem magicians outside of the academy who are pushing the same liesand the pushing the same irreverence for the sacred.And this is definitely one of them.And even as he disguises himself as someone who's reawakened to the sacred,I say no.Right, right, right.And what did you inject Tammy with?So we use something called exosomes.So the way I explain exosomes, I'm not going to...Did you hear that?I swear, I swear I did not know it.I swear I did not know this.I guess I must have known it because I wouldn't have put it in the,"Oh my gosh, why did I put it in the list notes then?"He said exosomes.Oh my gosh, he said exosomes.And then she has to train it over time to say,"Hey, this is a tear and this is not a tear."And then eventually it learns.Right, right, right, right.And what did you inject Tammy with?So we use something called exosomes.So the way I explain exosomes, imagine if you're going...So let's talk about stem cells first to explain exosomes.So most people have an intuitive concept of stem cells.They understand that they rebuild tissue or they repair tissue.So they can come from umbilical cord, they can come from fat,they can come from the bone marrow, they can come from amniotic fluid.There's so many different sources where we can get them.We use something specifically called mesenchymal stem cells,which is just an embryological term.Mesenchymal, holy shit, really.Mesenchymal stem cells, Jesus Christus, what a monkey.To explain their origin of where they're being derived from.And so, and the reason we use mesenchymal is because they're easy to access.Mesenchymal.For example, the most easiest place to access is after birth, right?You take the umbilical cord tissue or you take the amniotic fluidand you can isolate the mesenchymal stem cells or stromal cells is technically the right word.But anyway, most people call stem cells but MSCs for short.And so what you do is...There's lots of people who argue that the placenta and the cord should be left attached to the babybecause a lot of those stem cells are still making their way into the baby after birth.And so there's lots of people that say that if you cut that cord very early,you're actually robbing the baby of a lot of it's...a lot of valuable stuff.And so that's an interesting...a very interesting idea that I almost have to believe is truebecause if you think about how natural birth would normally go if you were on a campor you know, you were out camping with your wife and she had the baby,then you wouldn't just yank the placenta off or cut it off or pinch it off.The impetus might be to leave it there for a while.And so it's a very curious aspect of our birthing practicesthat in retrospect after having three kids,I can roll my eyes at how dumb I was as a biologistto have gone through three childbirths and having waited until 2024to have someone put in front of me the idea that hey,maybe we shouldn't clip the cord or pinch the cord or whatever we do,you know, five minutes after the baby comes out and maybe we should ask a questionas to whether that's a good idea.I can't believe I was so stupid to have had three childrento watch my beautiful wife give birth three times and never thought,hey, wait a minute, why are we clipping that right now?At least I had the wherewithal to go, holy shit,what are you injecting into my daughter after not seeing it done in Norway?And it still took me a year and a half to wake up to realize how bad that signal was,what that really meant about the American vaccine schedule.So I don't blame anyone for not getting it.I blame these people.I blame Jordan Peterson. I blame Brett Weinstein.I blame all of these people who have been slow rolling us to the truththat public health is a lie, that RNA can't pandemic,and that intramuscular injection of any combination of substanceswith the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.But exosomes are real and we can use them to do all kinds of things.You isolate those and then you can grow them in a lab for three to four months.Why are they an umbilical cord tissue?Why?Because there is a rich source of repair and regeneration of the most stem cells from that.Meaning the umbilical cord tissue is just rich in MSCs.So why are they rich in MSCs?I read that babies actually send stem cells into their mother's bodyto help the mother repair her own tissue.Right, there is that mechanism built in.So I think a lot of it is probably that crosstalk between the placental and the mother.Wow, nice work.Very good, Soothspider.I didn't see that you did that.I apologize.And the cool thing is your body has stem cells too, right?And you have stem cells in your body that are fat.Shout out to you, man.And there are basically cells that are undifferentiated that can turn into any tissue.Or I saw it and that's why I was in my list.So there are different types of...It's also possible that I saw it and that's why it was in my list.So if it is, shout out to you, man.You've been really big help.And more importantly, what I like about Soothspider is that Soothspider,he or she has never really tried to tell me what to do or suggest anything,has just made clips and translations and subtitles and posted copies of my videos.And so, humble thanks, man,because there are few people who have put the amount of energy into my work that you have.I mean, other people have, but the reason why I'm pretty convinced that you must be a decent dudeis because you've never really tried to push any particular thing on me.And I really appreciate that a lot. So thanks for all you do.Right. So I believe...And the cool thing is your body has stem cells too, right?And you have stem cells in your bone marrow and in your fat.And there are basically cells that are undifferentiated that can turn into any tissue.So there are different types of stem cells.If you have embryonic stem cells, which is from the fetus,then they can turn into any type of tissue.But as you know, embryonic stem cells during the Bush era and everything is controversial, right?And the reason for that was because they were saying,"Are we going to be harming fetuses?"Obviously that becomes ethical issues.And so no one... that never really took off.But luckily we figured out, "Hey, wait a minute, we have something that's..."There are lots of people that argue that Planned Parenthood has been selling tissue for years,and I'm sure they're right.Somebody like Vincent Ranson Yellow,every year that he teaches virology brags about foreskin being a congenitator,and that foreskin being a common source of cell culture material,seemingly to make light and normalize the cutting of the foreskin of newborn babies in America,because that's when they do it.It's not foreskin that's taken from Jewish kids when they're 14 years old.This is foreskin that's taken from newborn baby males,and sometimes they take all of it,not just the tip like they might in Islam or in Judaism.It's a complete removal of the foreskin,not to give you too much details about anything,but I lived in a Northern Wisconsin high school where it was normal.I don't know if my kids do it anymore,but it was very normal for us to all shower together after gym.And certainly we all showered together after basketball and after whatever,and a huge majority of males of my age in Northern Wisconsinfully circumcised,not even kind of, but fully circumcised with essentially no foreskin at all.And you have cellular physiologists who are totally fine with their cell cultures being derived from that.No, it could be just as bad as being derived from the nervous tissue of clitoris is cutting off of females.Why not?And so the amount of contradiction that is contained inside of the public health lie,the public health mythology machine is extraordinary.And none of these people seem to be fully aware of the cognitive dissonance and contradiction that they engage in on a regular basis as they talk about the stuff they do with the obvious naivety that they talk with it.It's awful.It makes stem cells, which is from the fetus, then they can turn to any type of tissue.But as you know embryonic stem cells during the Bush era and everything is controversial, right?And the reason for that was because they were saying, are we going to be harming fetuses?Obviously that becomes ethical issues.And so no one that never really took off.But luckily we figured out, hey, wait a minute, we have something that's almost as good as embryonic stem cells, not as good, but it's called pluripotent.Meaning it has ability to turn into many different types of tissue, but not every type of tissue.So they're slightly farther down the developmental chain.Exactly. It's not totipotent, it's pluripotent.And so those pluripotent stem cells, mizekimo stem cells are pretty ubiquitous.You can get them from dental pulp, you can get them from fat, umbilical cord.We talk about bone marrow, there's a lot of different sources.And so they're easier.So if you're cheap, you can get it from discarded tissue.If you have the money though, and I highly recommend you go this route,you can get it from fetuses and from aborted fetuses and even from placenta and these kinds of places which are considered a little lame because you know you might be damaging fetuses to get this stuff and that would be awful.But we can still have an abortion industry and we can still have a basically a black market for this stuff where where if there's enough money on the table everybody will agree to lie about it.Of course they will.And so there's there's pluripotent and totipotent.And so if you're here really, really rich, you'll get the totipotent.And if you're just trying to to be a normal doctor, I guess you get the pluripotent stuff.You're too harvest and easier to source.And because of that accessibility, that's where the research really took off in the last 10 to 15 years is with the MSCs.So are there variants of cells that are not very good for the brain?And so I think that research really took off in the last 10 to 15 years is with the MSCs.So are there variants of cells like is it a continual variant from the cells that are omnipotent?Did you say the ones that you put in the totipotent that can turn into anything and then there's the ones that are what was the next level pluripotent.Think about the concept that this guy purports to be some kind of polymath and and psychologist and and totem of wisdom.But is still needing to be told about these biological terms and he's a little slow.This isn't for him. This is for you.This is all an act to make sure that you absorb the biological nonsense that's on here and absorb the information that they're trying to get you to absorb,which is that AI is eventually going to take over the medical world or something, I guess.So the totipotent cells turn into the pluripotent cells.Is that the developmental sequence and then into specific issues?Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.And that's kind of how it can differentiate down the line.And so the difference between a stem cell and a cancer cell.So a cancer cell has some similar properties because it can essentially it loses a signal or in a sense it gets kind of hijacked and it loses the ability to stop killing itself.Meaning it stops apoptosis. So it keeps replicating right and has an infinite amount.It can keep going right.Right. And in some differentiated to some degree.Right. And that's why there's actually something called cancer stem cells.And so if we can target cancer stem cells and stop that process, so there's a dozen active area of research.Oh, whether or not there are cancer stem cells is an area of research.So again, this is adding to the immunomethology as soon as you you falsify a null hypothesis about cancer stem cells and write a paper with the title cancer stem cells and the abstract that says cancer stem cells may be the source of cancer.Now you have a whole new field and you have this little pigeonhole that you can develop a lab in and you can write grant applications on and even if you never find cancer stem cells, we can waste 10 years of research on it.And all the while the presuppositions that cancers caused by something other than toxins that we get or or.Do you see it.And the Academy magicians are not going to show you the weakness of this strategy.They're not even going to admit that the strategy is that that there are paparian, reiterative falsification of a null hypothesis around the existence of stem cells to cancer will create the illusion that stem cells will create theillusion that stem cells and cancer are a proven phenomenon.And that's what he means by this is currently an area of research.Do you see how it's going to be almost impossible for me not to turn on the stream every day because the I'm standing under a veritable Niagara Falls of of paparian science that has been foisted on us as knowledge, and then the mythology that has been constructedusing these false timbers.It's like being in a really bad game of of of Fortnite or Minecraft with somebody who's in creative mode and you're not.And so we've really got to respond in a very succinct and focused way so that these big narratives of AI and what it can and can't do can be stopped.And more importantly can be accurately understood by our young people and we need to get rid of the narratives of worst case scenario with regard to immunological threats and worst case scenario with regard to medical threats and worst case scenario with regard to public health.And we've got to enable our children to be able to see through this stuff by teaching them the biology that debunks it.By showing them where the border between understanding and irreducible complexity is so that they can see it for the beauty of what it is.So that they can see the edge of our understanding of cellular function more like another angle on Yosemite.So that they can see the borders of what we understand of how the brain is related to consciousness as the as the image that we get from a high powered telescope.That it's beautiful.That it's beyond our understanding at some point and that's what we have done with biology if we have done it faithfully.We have used our study to try and describe and bring people to appreciate the irreducible complexity of biology and the sacredness of who we are and have reverence for it.And instead over the last 20 or 30 years universities and academicians have wittingly and unwittingly participated in the abomination of that sacredness and the irreverence to it.And propagated this idea that science is a form of irreverence that science is the opposite of the appreciation of the irreducible complexity when it is exactly and at least it used to be science used to be the pursuit of appreciation of creation to show people exactly how wonderful creation is and why we should be in awe of it.And here we are a couple generations later where this adult and that adult seem to have no reverence for the sacred biology at all.They don't even seem to be aware it's there even as they talk about the limitations of their purported methodologies that have dismissed it.So they're not all stem cells are good right because people.And that's the problem with stem cell on differentiated tissue in the wrong place could be exactly lead to tumor and that's actually the problem with embryonic stem cells too.They're too strong.They have too much stemness meaning they can keep replicating and grow into tumors right where as mesenchymal stem cells they can they have a finite ability to different to grow so they don't grow which is why they're safe.And so.Oh OK.So when we grow them which is why they're safe.OK.So we understand there's a difference between these two generated sources of cells in terms of how they behave in certain experimental context.And then we're going to suddenly jump to we understand.You see that's how Academy magicians fool themselves and everybody that listens to them and everybody that funds their grants.Mesenchymal stem cells the soup that they grow in.So imagine the.How do you say that.Mesenchymal.How do you spell it.M E S E N C H Y M A L.Yeah.And it's going to take me a while to get that one right.Yeah.No it's an embryological term so yeah just call them M S E S.M S E S.Yeah.So M S E S.When they're grown.Imagine the M S E S.Are the chicken.It's possible that in only said he was in.Isn't he in.I don't know where he is.Is he in Canada now.Is this guy Canadian.Can you tell by his accent.Meet and the soup the broth is the exosomes.So the broth has all these nutrients and cytokines in there.But there's no actual stem cells.And why is that.Important because those exosomes can send all the signals which are the proteins the cytokines and growth factors to reduce inflammation and repair tissue without the sounds kind of like how they make viruses.Except now we're talking about stem cells and they just grow stem cells and then they take the medium off so stem cells are just emitting exosomes all the time.Are you suggesting that our tissues might broadcast RNA and DNA based signals and lipoprotein coats.A little bit like packet communication in in in computers.Really.And so there's no chance that this signaling regime might be confused, misconstrued or even lied about as being exclusively the Providence of.Obligate pathogens outside of ourselves and and bio terrorism or bio weapons.Is it really possible that after four years and not knowing anything at the beginning of the pandemic that Jordan Peterson hasn't done the requisite reading to think about any of this biology in depth.I think it's very possible that he hasn't because his success depends on it because he has been instructed what he should talk about.He's been instructed who she should amplify and he's told when he is going down the wrong path.Maybe even he gets sent to Russia when he goes down the wrong path. I have no idea what's going on here. I know.I have no idea how who's in control or who influences who who sits at what table.I've only got one picture of Joe Rogan and Weinstein and Shapiro and Ruben and Peterson sitting at the same table before the intellectual dark web is created.And I've only got a few press photos of the intellectual dark web and who it is composed of originally.Risk of having cells which sometimes can not survive or can cause reactions of certain people.So that's what you used on Tammy with Texas.But he told you right that he was descendant from another teacher. So this is a very typical apprentice who knows just enough to make the welds that he was taught to make by his welding teacher but doesn't understand why those welds are better than other welds or why he doesn't understand what other welds have been tried.He doesn't understand how arc welding that he does is different from from what is it gas welding is the other kind of welding or or you know I don't know TIG welding.I don't know. So for me, I think I see what a lot of these these people in the chat see you just see a very young doctor young doctors are trained to be this way to be confident in what they know to be confident in the structure of decision trees.That they're involved in and to be confident in the regurgitated details that justify or edify their understanding of the reality that they participated in.And so he's able to say mezen Kaimel and he's able to say that there's a difference between totipotent and pluripotent because someone else told him that and that he's read a couple people's explanation of it and that he's gotten good at putting it in his own words kind of.But it's not an understanding based on experiments that he's done.It's not based on and even though I'm sure that he's helped people by injecting these exosomes I'm sure that this kind of therapy works.I'm sure there's probably lots of biological reasons why it would work.But what it suggests is a bigger picture where exosomal communication at intracellular communication between tissues between immune system elements between nervous system elements between any elements of our multi cellular pattern integrity that is our body is probably ubiquitous probably normal in the healthy state.And yet by Rology needs to exist in the context and understand this very clearly by Rology and RNA by Rology in particular needs to exist in a context where exosome and exosomal communication using self replicating RNAs is non existence.By Rology needs to exist in a world where retroviruses are foreign and cause cancer where retroviruses are foreign and cause AIDS and other auto immune syndromes where retrovirus sorry Corona viruses are foreign and cause all kinds of all viruses are foreign.That's the reason why they need the word virus because if they said that there's a mixture of signals that come from bacteria and fungi and plants and mammals and insects and they're all we're all swimming in this hot background of RNA and DNA that's very hard to pull meaningful signals out of.Because most of the meaningful signals are not only ignored by our immune system tolerated by our immune system maybe even produced by our immune system. Instead they've sold us a dumb simple story about all of this being outside of our own biology.We just do DNA to RNA to protein that's it.We don't copy any other RNA.We don't use RNA to signal between cells we would never send self replicating RNAs through our system to communicate between things.Never mind retroviruses between immune system elements or other temporal sorry other tissue elements of the body to another no way that would be crazy.That's all the purview of the the Baltimore classification system of viruses.And the crazy thing is is that these two guys are so unsophisticated and so unwitting in their participation in the sustaining of this mythology that in teaching Jordan Peterson about the existence and the usefulness of exosomes derived from stem cells.Neither of these two super geniuses can get to the realization that holy shit. Does this mean that this biology might be present in other places that we might have confounded other things with this biology that we might be making mistakes and assuming that this biology isn't a part of our immune system or digestive system or nervous system.Of course they won't.Is the cells that are already there to to what to to repair themselves.What exactly this girl is a signal is a signal that says to your body.OK start repairing this tissue so send signals to your endogenous cell.So does it tell your does it essentially signal to the body that something's wrong.It's a sense to the bodies to start healing and regenerative pathways.Well I know that for example and correct me if I'm wrong but part of the funny thing is is that is he going to tell you what's in those exosomes.Or is it just whatever the stem cells are making.Do the stem cells make different things depending on what you feed them or how you treat them.Does it matter what medium you grow them on or what antibiotic you use or what temperature they grow at or what density they're plated at.You see the problem with being an academic biologist with 20 years of experience cell culturing and transfecting cell cultures and making recordings from dissociated ion channels and single ion channel patches and outside out patches with with with giant conductances.None of these mythologies stand the scrutiny that something like biophysics has with with stood none of the challenges to biophysics have ever been posed to virology.None of the potential experiments that could be done with the latest gene and sequencing technologies have been applied to virology at all.They've been applied to infectious clones and they find out that virology remains an illusion.And so after four years after all this available available data after him being a internationally famous polymath.He still needs to be taught the difference between totipotent and pluripotent stem cells has never heard the word mesenchymal before.And is still not really inquisitive enough to say what's in these exosomes.Are they all pure.Is it is it a bouquet of stuff that you need to characterize and and are you going to patent any parts of this stuff like none of these questions seem to come to mind because this guy's explanations just so rock solid reason that your face skin doesn't repair itself when it wrinkles is because your body doesn't actually note that the damage has occurred.And I know that some of the therapies that regenerate skin like intense pulse light produce enough damage so that damage is now signal right your body has to figure out.So the cross linking that occurs as a constant sense of sun damage is so subtle that it can you accumulate across time.There's no indication of damage.And so the exosomes signal to the body that something needs to be fixed.Exactly.I was given Viva Frye's phone number and I messaged him twice and I haven't gotten through to Viva Frye.So there was even a video that somebody posted in our our giga ohm soapbox where Viva Frye seemed to respond to the chat and say we should get JJ Kooley on the show and he seemed to say that he was going to do it.But somebody sent him sent me his number and I've already sent him my number and a text and I haven't heard from him.So maybe someone else can ping him or you guys can try to try to get that going again.And that's what this really is all about.And especially the first generation of stem cells.We'll talk about second generation.But first generation of stem cells is really about para kreen signaling which is basically signaling to the local tissue.Hey there's something wrong here.Start fixing it.And that's that's really what it is.And so exosomes in the case of Tandy's case they send a signal to reduce inflammation and then they send growth factors to help repair and regenerate the tear.So and then you can actually see if you do it follow up ultrasound which we do all the time that the tissue is actually repaired and regenerated.Can you do that system.So exosomes derived from stem cells.And he got this idea from a a a mentor.And now we're supposed to just say wow what great biology but we're supposed to be naive enough to not make the bridge and see that he is an approach approaching the sacred biology.The edge of the sacred biology here.Is it time.I can bring him.Yeah you should bring him and I'll pick him up then if that's OK with them.OK.I won't be that much longer but I want to finish themically.Yeah exactly.So intravenous stem cells or intravenous exosomes are being used a lot for a variety of neurodegenerative conditions autoimmune conditions chronic pain chronic inflammation.There's so many different things are being done for.There's a recent trial done for inflammatory bowel disease which is a really terrible condition.Yeah yeah and right now only really medications are like methotrexate or immunosuppressants carnivore diet.Yeah carnivore diet it does work actually.Yeah yeah but not everyone's going to stick to it.Yeah right it's a hard diet and a lot of doctors don't really know about it so they're not going to recommend it to their patients.Yeah so patients have to self educate right.Yeah and so instead of just suppressing your immune system what the intravenous stem cells do is they do what's called immunomodulation.So they actually reset or repair your immune system from a pro inflammatory state to an anti inflammatory state.And is that the exosomes or the stem cells per se.It's more the stem cells.So stem cells have a strong immunomodulatory effect.Exosomes don't have a strong immunomodulation.That's why you have to do intravenous stem cells if you want to treat something systemic autoimmune conditions.And there's trials that where patients have actually gone to remission and that's incredible to see because.Yeah you treated MS.No not to say that it won't work but please understand that if this does work it's not because they understand how it works.They just tell you a story or draw a cartoon about how they think it might work and then they ask for grant money to study it.And then they'll build a scaffolding and a model that seems to comport with the observations that they made in the past.And build this illusion of understanding that will try as hard as possible never to acknowledge where the sacred irreducible complexity that they're bumping up against is.And what parts of it that they can see they don't want you to see that they don't want you to know that they don't understand what they're doing.They just want you to think that another discovery has been made.Jordan Peterson is happy to accept that because he's never bothered to get sophisticated enough in his understanding of where the sacred biology is and where the irreducible complexity in biology exists.And so that means that he's not under any any impetus or any any moral obligation to share it with you.We have but MS is much more tricky because it's not just there is an autoimmune component to it.But then there's also there's a lot of other components to it.And that's where it becomes you have to take a holistic approach.Why don't you say that we don't understand how muscular I mean multiple sclerosis works in total.And so it's a more complex thing to attack.Why not just say that we don't know how to usefully augment a maladaptive immune system state like multiple sclerosis.It's still out of our the realm of our understanding and purview.So the way we're going to treat MS which we're working on is we're going to have the second generation of stem cells.So what that means is instead of just using umbilical core stem cells we create what are called gene edited stem cells.So we can actually take.So this is this is what Professor Yamanaka in Japan he won a Nobel Prize in 2014 for what's called discovery of pluripotent stem cells IPSCs.So what he discovered was that you could take any somatic cell in your body like a muscle a skin cell and you can reprogram it using genetic reprogramming to and turn it back into an embryonic stem cell.So that's that's sort of revert to an earlier form essentially.So I like to call the Yamanaka stem cell and basically it's a pretty crazy discovery if you think about it.The fact that you can your body has this almost innate ability to go back to like a infant state and but you just have to over your body.No you can do it in cells you can do it in culture we've done it with neurons it's kind of cool but it doesn't make them into a therapeutic tool.It doesn't mean that we understand the the potential negative consequences of these these genes being reactivated or these cells being induced to differentiate if that's what indeed they're doing express certain transcription factors to do that.And so that discovery was pretty incredible.You know the immune system does that too is that when it's when it's mutating when it's adapting to the presence of a new virus or a bacteria it'll produce more and more accurate gripping mechanisms right at the cellular level.He's talking about antibodies of course more and more accurate gripping mechanisms at the cellular level as antibodies look at this look at this.I thought he didn't know anything and have any special insight.But it stores representations of the ones that were part of the developmental sequence so can imagine that that an immune cell was trying to get a purchase on a bacteria.It'll sort of go like this first right it's not doing it very well but it'll stick a bit and then those what sticks a bit varies and then it'll stick a bit better and then that'll vary and then it'll stick a bit better like that.Well then it's the thing mutates this grip might not work but this one might and so that the information is still stored and if this one doesn't work well this one might so it stores that that developmental so there's more early variability unless fine accuracy.That that that that is just the worst explanation of immune memory that I've ever heard it is not based in anything remotely observed.And that that cartoon of his hands that he did that little hand puppet show was is just God awful and totally dead on balls narrative for trying to be dumb simple or stupid complicated to bamboozle our kids.That's not all you need to know in order to understand why vaccine schedule in America is criminally negligent why transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent why intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.There's a trade off right between sounds like the same thing is happening with the with the stem cells is that they'll differentiate into their final form which is specialized but that the possibility for earlier forms with potential is reserved exactly.Yeah you know that same thing seems to happen with regards to junk DNA.So at a friend tell me for example if you breed fruit flies and you breed them so that they don't have eyes you can do that you can alter them genetically so they don't have eyes and then you take the blind fruit flies and you let them breed amongst themselves for seven or eight generations.The eyes will come back because the genome takes information out of the junk DNA and rebuilds the eyes.And so even in the DNA itself there seems to be additional information stored so that the system can revert to an earlier stage of development and then progress forward again.It's just unbelievable that somebody who says that he doesn't understand anything can talk so confidently about shitty doesn't understand because someone told him.That's the worst level of under I mean it's just awful.It's it's hard to express how disappointing it is to to understand the scope of the reach that this guy has.And the amount of amplification that this guy has has been given with the sheer uselessness of the ideas that he shares with the world.It's the opposite of wisdom and knowledge.It is decapacitating everybody that listens to him and it's it's really impressive.So and that's that's really what I believe is you have 3.2 trillion cells or so in your body and I believe they're working for you but we have to figure out and give it the right signals so that you can heal disease and that's OK so he probably agrees then that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances the intent of augmenting the immune system is pretty dumb.If the body already has in eight ways of healing itself then we definitely don't understand how to activate or augment that with checking combination of substances intramuscularly right.And yet somehow or another he's not there as a doctor not there as a physician not there as a guy interested in health.He's dedicated his whole life to it but can't get there.That's what regenerative medicine the promise of it is really about which is that we can use customized cell and gene therapy to restore your body back to a previous state and that's the era we're finally in.It's finally in the era of personalized medicine genetically altered stem cells that they can cure diseases with or alter you or experiment on.No we're not there yet.We're there at the stage where they are ready to experiment with this stuff and they need to experiment on you.Because doing pluripotent stem cells or induced.The corus the symphony of genes and their regulation symphony of proteins and the symphony of the immune system is unique.And so we are indeed entering the era where we're not going to test and learn from animals anymore.They want your children ladies and gentlemen they want your children and the reason why they have been so adamant is because they want your children so that and they don't want you to be able to exercise informed consent over this change.And so you can't understand the truth or you would be able to say no saying no being a very important part of informed consent and the exercise of it.You may not be aware but I gave a three minute comment live to the FDA in 2022 smoked on the idea that the principle of informed consent has been ignored for the duration of the pandemic.And it's been done by the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses by a group of people that have agreed wittingly or unwittingly have agreed that a novel virus caused excess deaths and that one good way to understand what happened would be to investigate whether it was a bad cave virus or a gain a function leak.And how that cartoon story and the solving of the mystery by us has gone from being kind of a an insider's joke played on us to the nightly news to the main understanding across all red, white, blue, labor, conservative doesn't matter.Everybody thinks this what's happened everybody thinks that Fauci and NIH and Peter Desack did it covered it up. Maybe the Chinese are also covering it up who knows.Now we have to deal with the profiteering of people that have taken advantage of the crisis and the poor response to it.And in solving that mystery you've accepted the existence of a virus you've accepted the existence of a novel virus for which we were all vulnerable and the explanation that it killed a lot of people.And that's what got us rushed into transfection.And I am arguing that all of these people the no virus people the intellectual dark web the people on TV from the NIH and the people on the FLCC and the af and American frontline doctors.There are actors in every one of these groups and every one of these facets of our cage that are consistently agreeing to ignore or lie about or admit that or omit that fear uncertainty and doubt and confusion do not resuscitate orders over use of pulse oximeters in pure high flowoxygen the overuse of ventilators and lack of antibiotic use poor use of steroids the use of remdesivir and madazzlam opioid deaths being allowed to ramp up death certificate frauds being encouraged by financial incentives and legal incentives to declare covid so that malpractice was impossibletracking trace masks closures mandates PCR fraud lateral flow test fraud and sequencing fraud could be used to sustain the illusion of a pandemic that's just based on a background signal and non specific tests.And all of these people have collectively agreed to make sure that we pass on this mythology to our children that none of this shit matters because there was a novel virus and we were all vulnerable and it's still going and here funded both says it may be trouble for the vaccinated people in the future and it has nothing to do with theTransfection it has to do with the mutating virus and the last two days I've spent very succinctly I think over the course of several hours demonstrating why the position of no virus and its curation by the focus on isolation purification and viral cultureExperiments and never being able to get out of that hamster wheel to expand to the fact and say that in order to sustain the lie of virology they have consciously ignored all of these sources of death to murder people.They've never been able to get there.In fact they've insisted that any conversation that they have with someone outside of their circle is not addressing any of this stuff.But instead focuses exclusively on proving or disproving the culturing of viruses the isolation of viruses and the purification of viruses.And that is how they were just as bad as the people on television and just as bad as the people on social media.Just as bad as the people in the green here not the green square but the green circles that have been going around the world telling us that a lab leak virus killed millions of people but millions more were saved by an imperfect roll out of aTransfection that this guy invented and that bears is something to talk about for four years and that's it.And then they met Denny Rancor. Denny Rancor gave them data that showed that actually there wasn't a novel spreading additive risk pathogen that can explain the excess deaths but actually it was probably just dumb ideas and they ignored it all the way up until speaking in front of the senate.A month ago.And I believe these people just like some of the people behind or part of the no virus group just like some of the same people that are part of the NIH messaging on TV and social media messaging for those people on TV they are all part of a group of coordinated liars that have taken differentPositions that all one way or another support and reinforce and edify the presuppositions of the narrative that there was a novel virus that it killed millions of people but millions more were saved by an imperfectTransfection that the next generation of will be better and are a can definitely cause a pandemic gain a function viruses can really do it.So we've got to be afraid of it in the future and all of these people on TV social media and and they reinforce this narrative.By making you ask questions that will never actually penetrate it even the no virus people get you to ask questions that will never get you to the point where you will say Transfection in healthy humans was criminally negligent and thousands of academicPeople should have known it and they will never get you to say that RNA cannot pandemic because they'll keep you focused on viruses can't be isolated viruses haven't been proven these sequences are just background and they won't tell you theSignificance of it by then saying that that that's why they murdered people and here's how they murdered people they'll never get to the stage where they can say there's no virus and this is whyWhy don't you to stay exclusively focused on there's no virus because isolation purification culture isolation purification culture. Why not in four years has the no virus people never gotten to the stage where they can say that there was no virus and they killed people.Why is it that the people who say that they're that we had a bad response can't get to say that there's some component of this that's murder.Not one of them can say it.The only murder or damage they want to talk about is the Transfection that they still call covid vaccines.It's a coordinated group of liars that have contributed to books over the decades and books over the last four years and I was co opted for a while into this group of coordinated liars that tried to convince me that my ideas about infectious clones being the real methodology underlyingRNA, RNA biology, the real illusion is that there is no RNA biology.It is ex's normal communication and it is a hot background of this kind of communication being distorted has exclusively outside of us and the purview of David Baltimore's virology tree.It's a lie ladies and gentlemen you got to get out of the car and realize that our parents were in this car and our parents put us in this car and if we're not vigilant we're going to put our kids into this car and they're going to be driving away with these people into the future.Ladies and gentlemen the hypothesis that gets you out is that they lied about a dangerous novel virus using a very complicated and coordinated set of lies.That spanned across fields and social groups and languages and cultures to collectively agree on the potential for a pandemic to collectively agree on the potential for a pandemic and laboratories and in bad caves and then reinforcing the possibility of a worst case scenario to get maximum compliance created by the maximum confusion, because they want maximum compliance to the inversion of sovereignty to permissions.Ladies and gentlemen this has been gig on biological high resistance low noise information brought to you by biologists.This has been Sunday anti-academic hour.Casting spells is what they do.Oh I just cut without cutting.Ladies and gentlemen this has been gig on biological high resistance low noise information brought to you by biologists.This is the stream whose main messages is that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.Transmissions in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and thousands of academic biologists should be apologizing to you and the college kids that they mentor because they should have told them this in 2020.An RNA cannot pandemic and anybody that considers themselves an academic biologist at the Ph.D. level should be able to rub their chin and scratch their head for a couple hours and read a few papers and understand that we have been told something about RNA that biology does not support.I love you all very much. Have a happy happy Sunday.I'm going to the gym to shoot some buckets and to move around a little bit.I missed that yesterday because my stream went wrong and now the boys are already at the gym.So I got to get moving. Thank you very much for being here and I will see you guys again tomorrow.1010 ladies and gentlemen 1010 too bad he believes in ion channels indeed.What.What.What.What.≈ÅƒèƒèQ≈ÅƒèƒèQ≈ÅƒèƒèQ≈ÅƒèƒèQLot officers out casually knew last night if we had learned their methods last night.
