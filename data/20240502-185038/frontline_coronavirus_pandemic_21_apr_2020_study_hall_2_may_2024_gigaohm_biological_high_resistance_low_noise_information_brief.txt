We've offered China help, but we can't have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus. So we're going to see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes."That attitude didn't sit well with Washington's senior Democratic senator Patty Murray. She spoke to me from her home."I felt like at the time I lived in two different worlds. I lived here in Washington State where people were going, 'Oh my gosh, we have a problem,' and in Washington D where they'd say, 'Ah, you guys worry too much out on the West Coast.'A tale of two Washingtons.""Yeah. We should have pulled out all the stops and checked everything, but it was more like, 'Oh, you guys quit worrying out there.'"There was a lot to worry about. In isolation at Providence Hospital, patient one was deteriorating.""He began developing more shortness of breath.""Is it wrong for me to say, 'I don't find that an inspiring symbol if you're going to take the Christian cross and make it black and light it from the back? It doesn't feel like the optimum. I don't know. I don't like that at all. It's weird.""And because of that, we got an x-ray which looked like he had a developing pneumonia. His oxygen levels and his blood were also decreasing.""That worry, Dr. Diaz.""That worry, Dr. Diaz.""Oxygen levels were decreasing.""Oxygen levels were decreasing out of Wuhan.""It appeared based on their data that once patients began developing pneumonia that many of them end up in the ICU on a ventilator and die.""Patient one was slipping fast and there was no known treatment.""Dr. Diaz told me he heard about an antiviral drug called Remdesivir.""They are telling a story actually that this guy, wow, that he was slipping away and that Remdesivir actually saved him, which I don't remember this. I just know that they used it on him.""I didn't know that we were also told by PBS NewsHour that he was slipping away.""Wow.""Som experts thought could potentially help. It would be an experiment," he said, "but the patient was willing.""With that point, I contacted the FDA and Gilead, the manufacturer, to see if they would approve it.""So the FDA gave us an approval to try it on a compassionate use basis, knowing that it had not been approved yet and that there were no trials available to base that decision on.""But the domain server had already identified it as a main candidate, so they did have some good evidence because Robert Malone had created a computer-generated X-ray crystallography model of the three-CL protease and then interfaced all known pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals on the FDA list with that X-ray crystallography model"and identified Remdesivir, flubox, silicoxib, femotidine, and ivermectin as things that could potentially help.""Question, make sure you correct me if I'm wrong on any of those four, Mark.""By the next day, he was still having very high fevers and still was requiring oxygen the day that we gave it to him. By the next day, his fevers resolved and they stayed gone. He felt much better. He felt like he had started beating the virus."No one knew if the drug had an impact or if the virus was taking its natural course."Here's the thing, you have one data point here.""One person in the world.""It is an anecdote and so we were happy that the patient got better and was ultimately able to get better and able to go home. So that part was fantastic for the patient. We knew that we needed to study this in a formal clinical trial.""Although patient one was well enough to be sent home, for public health officials in Washington State, there were many more questions to answer. They needed to find out who patient one might have come in contact with after returning from China.""Track and trace! Warning, warning, track and trace, warning, warning.""And send samples from them to the CDC as well.""So we find contacts, I'm not used to that, at least ten minutes of time talking face to face with. We identified 60 plus contacts. We swabbed them multiple times to see was there a transmission of this virus and we found absolutely no transfer amongst those contacts at this first case end."Washington's governor Jay Inslee remembers this as a brief, optimistic moment. I interviewed him remotely from his office at the state capitol."What we were thinking is we were very much on top of it because we did very extensive contact tracing with all of the contacts that the person had who was the first patient and did everything epidemiologically that you could ask a public health system to do."But soon more signs of trouble began to appear across Lake Washington in the city of Kirkland at the Life Care Skilled Nursing and Rehab Center.Scott Sudlecek had brought his 86-year-old father there to recover from a bad fall."He had his head hard enough that he had some brain trauma and bleeding on the brain and he broke his right ankle. And the bed that opened up was at Life Care. And so on February 20th we moved my dad to Life Care and then we started seeing some of the staff wearing respiratory gear, wearing face masks, wearing gloves. He's kind of like, 'What's going on?'Inside Life Care, residents had been getting sick with an unknown respiratory infection. The sickest were brought to the nearby Evergreen Health Medical Center. Dr. Francis Rideau is the medical director of infection control here."Remember, this was flu season and we'd already had a peak of influenza B in December and now we were going through the peak of influenza A and so the unit was full of individuals with severe respiratory infections."Interesting statement."There wasn't a lot of effort to differentiate. It was going through influenza A and then influenza B. Wow, I want to play that one again just so you hear it right."This was flu season and we'd already had a peak of influenza B in December and now we were going through the peak of influenza A and so the unit was full of individuals with severe respiratory infections.In the meantime, in the background, we're watching these events unfold."The flu disappeared. That's incredible. This is a really wonderful little piece."With increasing alarm, not only in Wuhan, now spreading across the globe and wondering when our turn was coming.Until that point, federal guidelines for testing potential cases were very narrow. Patients had to have been in a hotspot like China or in contact with someone infected."See, so even the illusion of, you know, we don't have so many tests so we have to be very careful about who we use them on created this illusion in these people's heads that, well, we might be missing stuff then and then people were talking about missing stuffand talking about asymptomatic spread exactly as James Giordano explained in 2017 would be anybody wanting to destroy a country by undermining its trust in its government would do it this way.They would see the few cases of people complaining or maybe even tell a story about a case and then rely on the internet to spread the idea and then people would panic. Doctors would panic.Of course, if there was a coordinated messaging going on around the world between governments and coordinated control of people like Epigirl on social media or Brett Weinstein, you could easily have doctors no matter where they looked,healthcare workers no matter where they looked, parents no matter where they looked, teachers no matter where they looked and members of this bureaucracy, no matter where they looked,they would see convincing evidence of a consensus that there definitely is a global crisis unfolding and that New York City was the first page in a very terrible story to come."Then the rules changed. Dr. Rita wasted no time."We settled on two individuals and we tested them the following morning. I had a regular day, saw patients in clinic, saw patients in the hospital, was sitting there as I usually do trying to complete my notes and received a call at 7.40pm and both of the tests were positive."What goes through your mind?"My initial honest response was skepticism. I thought the odds of both tests and two randomly selected individuals being positive with no history of travel, no history of exposure to anybody was fairly astronomical.""Unless it was a pre-existing background that your dumbass never imagined, and I'm saying it with the utmost respect dumbass, because I was also a dumbass, I didn't get there until May of 2020, I was still about 40 days out from saying it out loud in my head."It took me a long time because people were talking to me behind the scenes about how important it was to oppose the no virus people and people like Andy Kaufman and how important it was to oppose people who thought it was 5G.""This was a huge shift. Incident command was activated and we made a quick decision to test nine additional people that night. Eight of those nine were positive.""I want to make sure everybody in the chat understands that in order to see through Robert Malone you have to be pretty sophisticated. It is very possible that there are lots of people who can't see through Robert Malone like we can."But you that have been here for a long time and have been following me for more than a year or two years or some of you have been following me for many years, whether you like it or not, the truth is that together we've learned a lot of biology, clarified a lot of biological ideas that make it very easy for us to regularly put our heads back in the box and then pull it out and have no ill effects."But the people who don't pull their head out have never pulled their head out of that box before. It's hard to see Robert Malone for who he is because he is a masterful orator because his wife and his relationship, that shtick is well developed and because his shtick is coordinated with other people."Many of the people that he says are in opposition to him are actually not. George Webb is not real opposition."George Webb is as real as I don't know who else to tie in with him because I'm just absolutely convinced that everybody that's been associated with him has been bamboozled by him, absorbed by him and he has taken what they do in their legitimate efforts to find the truth and obfuscated it in his own work under the hidden, you know, I'm promoting you kind of thing."Oh yeah, you're real smart." But then he gets everything that you said wrong or he doesn't even really say the name of your website or that's how he works and that's how a lot of these people work.And so my best estimation is that a lot of these people are essentially connected through Robert Malone and one of the best ways or lists to start with is the list that Robert Malone himself is made, lists on his own substack that say these are the people that are the meddlers that are messing with me that are trying to divide the resistance and are calling me a controlled up and then who does he list there?Well, I am on that list, but I don't have any links. Mary Holland has links, Catherine Watts, or Catherine Austin Fitz has links, George Webb has multiple links, including links to his 60 minutes episode.Sasha Latapova has links. All the people that are listed there basically have links to something that they're doing, except for me.That's because he would rather have you work on George Webb or decide whether Sasha Latapova is good or bad because as long as you're worried about those people, you're worried about people on his team and running in wheels that he essentially directly or indirectly coordinates, maybe even funds because he has a wonderfully,financially successful substack.I assure you that I'd be on almost every day for eight hours a day straight if I had 55,000 people giving me $5 a month.I would be celebrating the fantastic opportunity I would have to fund other people like Mark Kulak or Jessica Hockett or start a new news website where we promoted other people on this independent bright web.That's what I would do with any extra money I had. I would create a day camp for kids and biology or a summer camp for high schoolers or a summer camp for college kids in the middle of Pennsylvania with archery and fire building and camping and immuno 101.What are these people doing with their extra money with their foundations? What are they creating? What are they giving to the next generation? Not a whole hell of a lot, it doesn't seem.Robert Malone is building more buildings on his plot of land at the foot of the Shenandoah National Forest. Merrill Nass has decided after 10 years of taking support from CHD has decided to start her own nonprofit because I guess the money is so good or something.Oppose the who, not the vaccine schedule in America, not to bring awareness to vaccine injured kids, not to do anything but oppose the who.Because you know the main frontline warrior against the who should be an old lady who lives in Maine.Ow, right. It was stunning actually, isn't it? It was. And within the first five days, we had 32 positives.Many were from life care, but crucially, some had no connection to the nursing home.We then knew that this was a much bigger outbreak than you could have imagined.And these 41 life care residents and two visitors would eventually die with more than 100 others linked to the home testing positive, including Scott Sudlechech's father, Chuck.He has never shown symptoms. So how worried are you that symptoms might appear?Extraordinarily. Because we don't know. This is new. It's uncharted waters.The Sudlechech story hit home for me. My 84 year old father is in assisted living in Florida.Hello there. Can you tilt down a little bit? I'm sorry, what? Tilt down, tilt down. A little more down. There you go. That's good. How are you feeling?Well, I'm fine. How are you? No coronavirus so far.There's the coronavirus map in the background that is hilarious. Apparently, John Cohen invented the code that underlies that claim to fame.But he's pretty much in isolation. No visitors allowed. It's the same at life care, but the Sudlechechs have found a way around that.My sisters here and we'll go up and we'll say hi through the window. We've got a big whiteboard today so we can actually write notes for them because they're dumb.That is absolutely vomitous and it was part of the illusion that they had to separate old people from their lifelong mates, their love. They had to die alone and it started with this bullshit right here. Make no mistake about it.I'll double pane windows to seal the noise. Can you hear us? You idiots.Okay, well, let's your finish then. Keep getting better. Keep listening to the nursing staff. They're looking out for you.He has to get the love from the family to get better. Without it, he will become not just physically but mentally. It's the worst thing he can do to an older person. The worst thing he can do.So we'll do it anyway. So we'll do it and laugh about it. Somebody slapped this guy upside the head at this time. We might have not been where we are now.Scott himself also got the virus. Unlike his dad, he got sick.I was hospitalized through the emergency room with the full blown list of symptoms, extraordinary difficulty breathing, light headed dizziness. You name the symptom, I had it.What was it like being in isolation sick with this disease? Were you scared?Well, yes, I was scared. It's an unknown. I was hooked up to an IV and they started an albuterol nebulizer, which they had to give two full rounds of it.Which was something that they made fun of Trump by saying that they were inhaling bleach.But after those two full rounds, I was breathing normally and after six hours, they had all my symptoms under control.Within 12 hours, they moved me to a full isolation unit and 10 hours later, they released me with zero symptoms.So no remdesivir. Interesting. I guess he just got albuterol or whatever it's called.But the number of coronavirus cases at home and abroad continue to climb. The financial markets rocked and more aggressive steps to fight the coronavirus.By this time in early March, COVID-19 cases were multiplying here and around the country.Here we go. Here comes New York.Governor Inslee had put Washington under a state of emergency. The first governor to do so.But like many here, he was increasingly concerned that President Trump was continuing to downplay the threat.Inslee, a democrat and former presidential candidate, tweeted that the administration should stick to science and tell the truth.It would ignite an escalating war of words. During a visit to the CDC, Trump fired back.Because that governor is a snake. Inslee, let me just tell you, we have a lot of problems with the governor.And the governor of Washington, that's where you have many of your problems. I said, no matter how nice you are, he's no good. That's the way I feel.At that point, did you get the sense that you as a governor and the state of Washington were sort of on their own and the federal cavalry was not coming?Yes, but we didn't ever depend on that leadership coming out of the White House.So it's not something that we were surprised by. We always knew that we would have to lead the charge, given the president's reluctance to really exercise leadership on this.And we sort of knew that he had an intent of downplaying what was an emerging problem that could only be explained by someone who had their eye on the Dow Jones rather than eye on the epidemiological curves.Seattle's mayor, Jenny Durkin, shared those sentiments.We are not going to be distracted by any rhetoric that the president or anyone else uses. We've got to act. We've got to act to protect the people. And I think those actions are what matters.Facts and science got to rely on them. That's the only thing that's going to get us through this. And fortunately, we've got a really vibrant health and science community here in the state of Washington and Seattle, and we listen to them.She and other political leaders here had some hard decisions to make after hearing grim predictions.We had researchers here telling us that within six weeks we would have over 70,000 positive cases and hundreds of deaths if we didn't act.And so we had a choice to make. The choice was, know that you're going to have enormous pain in shutting down parts of your economy.And this is actually right. This is generated by the illusion that was created in New York. Make no mistake about it. This idea of projecting 80,000 people, that that projection only works if they believe what's occurring in New York City at this time.Make no mistake about it. That's the reason why they want you to ignore Jessica Hockett, why they want you to ignore the very simple observations that she's made and her friend has made that these things are not natural.These curves are not natural. These numbers are not natural. And they need to be substantiated because these very unnatural numbers were used to create the illusion of impending doom.The worst case scenario being a novel virus going endemic.Or have those same impacts later and overrun your health system.As we move forward, it will be increasingly necessary and important that we are unified in our efforts.Seattle was starting on a trajectory that the rest of the country would soon follow.There is no magic silver bullet at the moment medically, but there is a very successful effort that we can take to slow the spread of this disease. And that's to reduce the social interactions that are not necessary in our lives.You, the county executive and the governor, were early out of the box on taking these actions. Pretty proactive. Did you feel at the time a little nervous about all that?I think it was all of us felt a great deal of sense of obligation and concern because we were the first to go.Mayor Durkin actually had a pandemic response plan on the shelf, which she and her cabinet had updated in early February.We pulled out the pandemic planning and knew that one of the first things we had to do to separate people from another is have them telecommute those that could. So our largest employers acted immediately.That included Seattle icon Microsoft with a workforce of more than 50,000, one of the largest private sector employers in the region.So we had a call on Sunday afternoon, March 1. We had the business leaders from the...Microsoft president Brad Smith spoke to me from his home.We went from Monday telling people they should work from home if they were more comfortable. Tuesday telling people, you know, feel free to work from home. It might be better. To Wednesday work from home unless it's essential. You come to work.The decision you made was a big one. Did you hesitate?No, it was interesting once we decided at Microsoft that we would be decisive and base our decisions on public health advice, then we knew what to do.It's the hardest decision I've ever had to make because all of our instincts are to grow the whole economy for your city to make a stronger community for everyone.And what we're saying is we got to stop that kind of community and we have to stop doing work.Almost overnight, the vibrant city shut down. Businesses closed. Storefronts boarded up.Did he have my chair? Did he have my chair? Did it have chain mail on it? Because this is a real chain mail hood right here. If I put this on, I can go into battle. That's what that's for.The famous "Pyke Place Market" nearly deserted. At a local soccer field usually filled with kids and families, preparations for a surge of COVID patients.Yeah, we got to build those tents.We knew already that one of the biggest challenges would be having the hospital system overwhelmed by a wave of cases.We were trying to figure out how we could get testing. We were trying to figure out how we could get testing.It's not silly though because what they want you to do is to subtly see that the divide about the understanding and the acceptance of the science and the acceptance of the inevitability, the divide actually occurs right there.It's right there on the red-blue line in America. It's pretty impressive.Man, they're going over the house all the time now. I think I'm being watched.We would receive material help in the form of field hospitals or large facilities encampments for people who were unhoused. There wasn't a lot of concrete offers of help coming from the federal government.We were left with the reality that we're going to have to take on a lot of this ourselves.More than 140 people lost their lives yesterday, bringing the death toll to over 590 in this country.Nice red America there, boy. That's pretty shitty. Can't get much worse than that, can it?Lost their lives yesterday, bringing the death toll to over 590 in this country.He's not doing everything he can do here.As coronavirus was sweeping the country throughout March.And I can't tell you how frustrating it is.So was the frustration among governors scrambling for resources they needed to respond.We're bidding against one another. It's really not a great...Bidding against one another for tests and as response stuff like this was all manufactured.All manufactured shortage, all manufactured drama. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.All the states are taking action to try to find these things on our own.The president was now feuding with multiple governors.400 ventilators. I need 30,000 ventilators.And like he'd done with the virus in the beginning.I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.He disputed there was a scarcity of crucial medical equipment like masks and ventilators.Many of the states are stucked up. Some of them don't admit it.30,000 ventilators. That would have been a ventilator for everybody they killed in those five weeks.Amid the feuding, doctors and nurses have struggled to get the personal protective equipment PPE they need.Good morning and welcome everyone.I'm Dr. Amy Compton Phillips, chief clinical officer of the Providence Hospital Network.Last year across all of Providence we used 250,000 masks.In the first three months of this at Everett they've used 250,000 masks.We cannot have our own caregivers going down from COVID while they're trying to take care of the community.Because you know the supply chain is just not keeping up with our needs.Amy, I have to say if I can't assure them that they're safe, then I don't think the rest of this is worth anything.Inside Providence's emergency department, tensions around PPE have been high.Dr. Ryan Kay is the department's medical director.It's exhausting to constantly think about the sequence that you put things on and take things off and where you're sanitizing during that sequence.See that's all part of the... I don't know if you can still hear me, I wasn't monitoring.That's all part of the illusion, right?They are told that they have to pay attention to all these details and they have to pay attention to all these protocols and question whether they're doing things right.And so they focus their attention, right?Their attention is focused on something that doesn't help them solve the problems in front of them.But except the problem is in front of them instead.Every physician I've talked to has said I've been working for years and I've never been so exhausted.And it leaves people just on edge all the time.We have enough N95 masks that people should not have to bring in their own masks at this point in time.Is this a recommendation still on one N95 for five patients or are we using these all shift now?We're using them with a face shield for as long as you need to use them.You just store them in a paper bag until they become moisture-soiled.OK, so forever?Well, not forever.Reusing masks and storing them in paper bags wasn't the only DIY workaround I saw.I caught up with Dr. Compton Phillips at the otherwise vacant Providence headquarters.Inside a large meeting room, she and a handful of her team were spread out a safe distance,cranking out face shields.Our caregivers would normally have protective goggles on.I think Kevin McCarron had his wife making face masks and actually encouraged people in March of 2020 to make face masks,because at least it's doing something.Brett Weinstein was saying that he was wearing goggles and a bandana when he went out because, you know, bushmeat.I had a surgical mask underneath this, and then this goes in front and basically protects against droplets.They had raided a half dozen craft stores to scrounge up supplies.We're at 288 now. We're going to get to 1,000 by tomorrow.Wow, good for them.We're going to bring our resources going into war against COVID.I feel like Rosie the Riveter.499, 500!And what does this exercise do?It creates an illusion of consensus inside of their own head that's agreed with by all the people in the room that we're doing what needs to be done.We're doing it right. We're trying our best. We're helping out.It's also what happens when people protest together.They think, well, obviously I'm not wrong.And look at all these people around me who agree.This enchantment is amazing.And we have to pull our kids out of it.On the one hand, this is really, it's kind of heartwarming, but it's also really sad.Desperation?Yeah, I can't decide which way to go on this. What are your thoughts?I would rather offer our caregivers something than nothing.And at the moment, you know, if the choice is not having PPE or having homemade PPE, we're going to offer them homemade PPE.That's what motivated Jeff Cos. His small family business builds and sows furniture for aviation and retail customers.He decided to pitch in and start making masks.It's not as short as the raw materials at least. That would be about, you know, not yet.There will be.Yeah, there will be. Yeah, so I think we have enough to make 2 million masks.But how long will that take you to do?Well, it depends on how fast we want to go.How fast do you want to go?We're going to solve the problem.My assumption is that we'll be ramping up for several weeks and then drop off a cliff.Nobody will need me in the healthcare business anymore.And then survival becomes a question for my company.So that's probably the next.So he's really doing it all for the, for the good cause.He's going to throw it all at it. And when, when it's over, it's over, right?Wow, what a, that's amazing.Again, this is an unwitting participant.I'm not saying he's a witting participant.He sees that it's only going to be for a little while because that makes sense to his common sensical mind.This pack couldn't possibly last until 2024 where there would be college kids still wearing masks.That would be impossible. That would be crazy.A scary thing, which is less scary than what our healthcare friends are going through right now.That's the bigger issue for me.Holy shit.We knew in January what we would need.We knew we would need gloves and masks and respirators and ventilators.Two and a half months later, we're dependent on sewing circles to supply our frontline heroes with what they need.It may be a nice American story. I find it pathetic.I do too.Let's go back to the desk for a second here.Let me just show you.I'm going to locate this mask, which is branded, which is branded Con Selmer.That's the company that makes instruments and shit and music books and music stands.It's got little rubber thingies.It's double layered.It's got this little mouth hole in it.It's got a little separate tag for the person that made it here, United Sound.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.It's got a little rubber thingies.Washington State officials, like others in the country, say this was an avoidable crisis.Because we've lacked the federal leadership we needed, it's been mayor versus mayor, city versus city, state versus state,trying to get access to the limited resources to protect our communities,whether it's ventilators or masks for our health care workers.All of that has become this hunger games process where everyone's trying to figure out a way to outbid each other.Washington State had a line on masks that were coming to the country.You can look in the spars pandemic document to find similar tales of shortage and response to it.And all of the nefarious things that would happen when such a shortage was created.You know what's really crazy is that at the University of Pittsburgh there was this guy who was like one of the head engineers at the hospital or at the University Medical Center.He decided to steal like $15,000 worth of masks and sell them on eBay and got caught.I mean, that's the kind of shit that was going on in America.That's the kind of people, the kind of human behavior they were motivating with this kind of rhetoric.At the port in California, suddenly multiple states were bidding on them.That shouldn't be the way that it happens.We are searching the world for every potential warehouse that any of this personal protective equipment.That has been a constant struggle and we are bidding against each other.And I'm sure that the suppliers are having a field day bidding the price up while states are bidding against one another.It would be much more efficient economically and otherwise if the federal government was playing a more vigorous role in that regard.The tensions between states and the federal government have been escalating.Another 5 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week and that would bring...Not just over the response to the outbreak....the market down 10% in relatively short order.There's a lot of bad news...But now over what it will take to get the country up and running again....there's a massive meltdown on a national scale....because more jobs lost in a matter of two weeks than in the entire 18 months of the great...Our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war.Which we are calling opening up America again.The president has been pushing governors to reopen soon.Even as soon as May 1.Our country has to get open.And so of course the magic trick here is they know they've already created the psychological trap where half of the country can't listen to this guy without going...So no matter what he said here, no matter how realistic or how obvious it was, no matter how common sensical it was, because they had him saying it, half the country was just going to go...And they pulled similar tricks with similar people.Like Tucker Carlson has that effect on some people.Like Glenn Beck has that effect on some people. Alex Jones has that effect.Tim Poole has that effect. Sam Cedar has that effect. Brett Weinstein has that effect.It's either you love them or...And that makes them the perfect tool for creating this multifaceted fifth generation controlled demolition of all that freedom represents.And sovereignty is defined as in the West.That's why somebody like me who's got a multiracial background, who's a Christian recovering Catholic, somebody who was in academia long enough to know what's broken with it.Somebody who has been right from the very beginning, basically not even knowing why at first is still lounging around, languishing around, or whatever the right word is, languishing is the word I was looking for.Llanguishing around on Twitch with less than 4,000 followers after four years.And anybody that's been following me for more than a little while knows that our message is good enough for it to be farther than that by now.Our message has been succinct enough to have gone farther than that by now. Our message has been heard by enough of the people that are in this narrative to know that it should have been gone a lot farther by now, but it hasn't.It's been lost in the cacophony of repeatedly amplifying Robert Malone for three or four podcasts a day. At one point he was doing up to nine podcasts a day.Nobody's asking for Jonathan Cooey to come on their show. Everybody wants Sasha Latapova. Everybody wants Robert Malone. Everybody wants Pierre Corey. Everybody wants these people who've already done the circuit have already sold their book.And haven't evolved or moved on in their message at all other than health freedom and stuff.Only Peter McCullough has really progressed in his message to the point where he's able to succinctly say that I think the vaccine schedule is fricking criminal.And if I was a parent I wouldn't use it. I wouldn't engage in it. Think about that for a second because that's real.And it will get open and it'll get open safely and hopefully quickly.But some of them have been pushing back.We cannot be guided by emotion. We need to be guided by where the facts on the ground, science and public health take us.We need to know what's best for the people of Illinois, their safety and health and listening to the scientists and the doctors.Because if you do it wrong it can backfire.And many, like Inslee, say it will come down to one thing. Mass testing.This is the number one challenge for the United States right now is we need a huge ramp up of our testing capacity even greater than was needed early in the outbreak.Increased testing. Inslee says Trump needs to order US industry to help using the Defense Production Act, which the president has only just begun to do.We need the president to help ignite a national mobilization of the manufacturing base of the United States.That is absolutely imperative so that we can restart our economy.But President Trump has also thrown this back on the states.The governors are responsible. They have to take charge. They have to do a great job.There are limits to what a state can do though, as I saw at Washington's Health Department Laboratory.They can only complete about 300 tests a day and that requires a mad scramble.The raw materials for test kits are hard to come by.We have a lot of testing lab capability, but we don't have the equipment to swab everybody's nose.I think the current status in Washington state.Well, it's weird because I'm working on helping someone with a case on the west coast with a testing facility that opened up in April.And they had four machines called Quant Studio 12, which is what essentially could be a core facility machine at a university that can do all kinds of sort of preconceived program.Preconceived experiments on full genome sequencing, disease marker screens, all this kind of stuff and do 486 well experiments.And this company on the west coast was able to source materials that worked in this machine from a company called BGI in China and get that protocol approved in April of 2020.And presumably with these four machines, they were able to sequence hundreds and hundreds of people per day to test hundreds and hundreds of people per day using a protocol provided by a Chinese company, one of the largest foreign collaborators in the human genome project.BGI, Beijing genetics, something, something. I don't know maybe whatever it is. You can look it up.Why is a Chinese company providing the testing materials for a testing facility on the west coast that was testing a major metropolitan areas municipal employees including their police weekly.Why was that company able to source for gigantic machines and the materials to use them as a coronavirus testing methodology, get that approved by the FDA and presumably be able to test all the employees of this city every week, where these people in in Seattle that were supposed and they all prepared so they, they could test the first.Lucky enough, they had already run a drill, but these people only had the facility to test 300 people a day.That's amazing actually is limited by the supplies to actually run the test.They also don't have enough PPE for the healthcare workers 40,000 tests in New York City, but they could only do 300 a day there just.I mean, don't get excited if there's too much incongru and see it can't possibly be a crime is administering the tests.If we don't have enough gowns gloves masks to treat patients. How are we going to prioritize a gown a glove and a mask to swap somebody because that is the requirement.The state health department is actually got to have a gown on to do that shit. So you need, you know, that's a problem. We can't test everybody if we don't have the PPE to test them. I mean, that is such an amazing story.And alone and struggling to meet the demand.We can have that level across contamination.After getting approval for his test from the FDA, Alex Greeninger has dramatically ramped up testing at the University of Washington School of Medicine, virology.So they're doing COVID testing in there from patient samples and they're trusting the hoods alone to protect them because they're not wearing masks, even though there's potentially more virus in this room than there is anywhere else in America.For inpatients, healthcare workers.To test these people, you have to wear all the PPE. But you know, if we're working on the samples in mass, we don't need to do anything. We can just breathe all we want.Nothing's coming out of me. Holy shit is this incredible. Can you believe this?Usually populations, but mostly inpatients and people who need supportive care. We got to get that fast turnaround time that reduces the use of protective.On this day, they completed about 3000 tests.To get 3000, 4000, 5000 specimens a day, you know, it takes a lot of folks.5000 specimens a day are going through that room, but he can stand there without PPE on and without a mask and it's all fine because you know negative flow hoods are really good and they prevent all possible transmission and we couldn't contaminate it any samples because remember how a negative flow hood works.If they're doing it that way, holy shit. If they're doing it that way, then the person sits in front of the hood and the hood is like this and it's got this window drawn down and they're reaching in here to work on stuff.And so if this is a negative flow hood, then it would be flowing out, right?And if it's a positive flow hood, it's going to flow in and I might have those wrong, but the one that you work on when you're working on a virus is you work on the flow in because you don't want any of the virus that you're working on to get out.And if you're using a flow in hood without a mask on, what are you doing in the world of coronaviruses and respiratory diseases that are aerosolized? Holy shit.And if you're working on a negative flow hood where it's going out like this because what, you don't want to contaminate these samples with unclean air, then that means you're opening and testing all these samples while you breathe everything that blows out of the hood.So either way, this doesn't make any sense.And in fact, when I used to work in an operating room and load IVs as a pharmacy technician using a negative flow hood and it was flowing in, we had to wear a mask.There was no coronavirus back in the 90s. We just wore a mask because this stuff was going to be sent into the operating room and we were working in the operating room and you wear masks in the operating room so you don't cough on shit and breathe on shit.And when you talk, you don't spit on shit.And you use a negative flow hood so you can't do it either.It's one or the other, right? You see the problem here and neither of those, these possibilities is being respected in this video. It's like a joke to me.Either these things are full of samples and they're blowing out into the room.And so you're relying on everybody to keep it very frickin clean in there and open those things with very, very high precision or the deadliest virus and recent human memory is going to get out.Or it's a flowing in and then what are all these people doing to these samples? Aren't they contaminating them?And of course there are going to be molecular biologists on here who are going to say, "Oh yeah, but you know that or this or that. You got that wrong." No, I'm just pointing out the incongruancy here.I'm pointing out the incongruancy of the people walking around in this room. None of them having masks on yet they're supposedly doing tests in here.And supposedly it's asymptomatically spreading. Do they test themselves every day before they get in here with the potential of contaminating a sample or 100?Are they even thinking about that possibility seeing as they don't really understand how this RNA works and how it could be so infectious you think they would err on the side of caution they were making?For inpatients, healthcare workers, institutionalized populations, but mostly inpatients, people who need supportive care. We got to get that fast turnaround time that reduces the use.I'm sure I have the negative and positive mixed up. I don't care. I'm not a technician with regard to material safety in a laboratory. I just took the course and passed the web exam.But when you're using a hood like this and that hood is there, there are two strategies and whatever strategy they're using, it doesn't make sense with regard to how these people are dressed and how they're behaving.If indeed we believe the first half hour, which said that this is a deadly pandemic that's going around the earth that we have to do everything to stop.And now we're getting 3000 samples a day into this room, but all these people don't treat it like they are in the heart of the beast. They treated like they're just any other molecular biology experiment.Virology lab.For inpatients, healthcare workers, institutionalized populations, but mostly inpatients, people who need supportive care. We got to get that fast turnaround time that reduces the use of protective.This day they completed about 3000 tests.To get 3000, 4000, 5000 specimens a day, it takes a lot of focus.Just like in the state lab, Greeniger says it is difficult to get the raw materials he needs. One of the hardest things to find is the single use plastic tips that contain the chemicals and the specimens.Some automated piper is used for tips to test. Another is used three.And some can use 400 and some, you know, or 10 or 20. I mean, they can have many wells. And so where are these things coming from? Who's producing them? Who's checking their quality? You see? You see?And so just getting the tips into your facility so we can run that many tests.So this is what we're looking for basically. We tweeted at Roche and the world to get these things in. Like you would tweet like Delta lost your bags or something like that, right?I mean, we have two people whose entire job right now is to manage our FedEx shipments. Basically we blow up our hallway and it goes down to a single.So the problem they're solving is a shortage that was illusion of consensus that a shortage existed, a illusion of consensus that they needed more. Like 30,000 ventilators was a shortage that they were a shortfall number.And so they're asking the wrong questions and they're fighting the wrong battles and they're solving the wrong problems because all of the questions they ask, all the problems that they solve and all the arguments that they have all except the novel virus that has a shortfall number.So that has the potential to be a worst case scenario?A file and then it takes over the next six to eight hours. We're able to actually move those boxes into our local warehouses. We bought other space here in the building.It's just supply chain has been really the number one thing we do.Despite the problems, they're still managing to return results the same day in many cases.This is crucial to keep up with a fast and help health care workers on the front lines reduce their.I'm going to leave the last some minutes for you guys to find and I might watch the rest of it. I think we've made a lot of points here already. I'll watch it and figure it out.I need to skedaddle because oh, I forgot to cut. That's how we do that.I need to skedaddle because I'm going to help my wife live stream her class now.And if necessary, I think I will be on later to cover the last little bit of this if something incredible is in the back, you know, like if Robert Malone shows up in the last 20 minutes of this, then I'll let you know.I think we see already what we thought we would see. I think we've made a really good point about it.I do really think that this pandemic was created by seeding again a function narrative before the pandemic seeding the potential before the pandemic, and then during the pandemic cashing in on that already accepted potential and accepted existence in these in these groups in these peoples in these in these selected hospitals and locations.And then that story was misconstrued for national security reasons to make sure that everybody conformed with the mythology. And so teamwork is case scenario was very important in convincing us that there was a dangerous novel virus that strange new thing, but it there.I don't believe that there actually was. And if there was, it was likely deployed was it a toxin in some places and a clone in other places. I don't know because it's a crime and I'm just calling the cops.I know for sure that they're trying to invert the sovereignty of our children so that they can use them as test animals. Ladies and gentlemen, this has been giga owned biological high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by biologists.Thank you very much for joining me. And you can see me again tomorrow at 1010. I'll try to be early. Thanks, guys. I love you very much.[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]
